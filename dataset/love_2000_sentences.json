    "i love your body baby , so fking much",
    "i loved the look of her place , it was open space and airy with windows all around with a view of the park and a bit of the city skyline .",
    "she came back out with an overnight bag and dressed in a pair of her own jeans and a pullover .",
    "cynical , do nt give a fk and a beast in the boardroom  love and marriage was nowhere on my horizon  until three nights ago when i d looked into her eyes across a stage .",
    "my mom taught me and i love watching the cooking channel , you really like it ?",
    "could a man really make love to a woman that much without some kind of feeling involved ?",
    "i love how fking responsive she is , the way she lights up as soon as i put my hands on her .",
    "chapter 7 for the next three weeks , we stayed hidden away in our lover s paradise .",
    "i knew it was selfish  she had a life , a career that she loved .",
    "i kept pulling out to tease her with the piercing in the end of my ck because i knew how much she loved that , but not giving her enough to get her off .",
    "i love those noises she made as i fked into her my ck ring was hitting her just right and she started pushing back trying to get more of my twelve inches inside her .",
    "i love you too , but this is nt about that .",
    "i would nt have chosen a moment of anger in which to tell her that i loved her , but she d chosen the time and place .",
    "we played , we laughed we enjoyed each other and the more time went by , the more in love with her i became .",
    "maybe it s because we were able to keep our romance out of the public eye , but i was having more fun being in love with him than i d ever thought possible .",
    "i especially loved the way he made love to me .",
    "i d told my family about him and dad and him had had a few private conversations over the last few weeks that i was nt privy to , but my family seemed to love and accept him even with the age difference .",
    "at first her shyness ruled her , but i soon had her saying and doing anything she loved .",
    "she tensed and her body tried to expel me but i soothed her with soft kisses around her ear and down her neck , whispering how beautiful she was and how much i loved her .",
    "i did nt make love to her that night .",
    "she was the one and only baby i d ever held in my arms , and the love i d felt then , could nt be compared to what i felt for the unborn child shiane now kept safe in her womb .",
    "with my hands holding both sides of her head , i held it back so i could look into her eyes as i loved her .",
    "i love knowing my child is inside you",
    "do nt get me wrong , i love it , in fact i think i need it because my hormones have been out of whack from day one  but i wondered how others would see him .",
    "he was right i guess , as a small town girl , seeing all those zeros on my account balance was enough for me , i was just happy doing what i loved most and the fact that i was actually being paid , well .",
    "one day we were sitting at the kitchen table , i was still sitting in his lap because we d just made love while our breakfast had grown cold .",
    "and so my daughter was born , totally unexpected but completely loved .",
    "cara , the love of my life !",
    "my mom is so gorgeous and always loved the attention her looks brought her , but her vanity has always worried me .",
    "oh , oh , i did nt thinki mean , i d love to , but i justif nate wants the   then it s settled ,  pierce cuts in .",
    "i love having someone else to cook for again .",
    "i pull my face out of the pillow and crawl to the nightstand , pulling my dogeared copy of lady chatterley s lover out of the top drawer .",
    "i know what lady chatterley s lover is about ,  he says , looking at me with a smug grin .",
    "well i d love to get lunch later this week , but i m having lunch with my friend allison today .",
    "i d love to go with you sometime .",
    "i love going out there .",
    "i d love to see you again after tonight .",
    "like any good maryland girl , i absolutely love crabs .",
    "i love allison , but thinking in shades of grey is not her strong suit .",
    "i love champagne ,  sophie pipes up , finally putting her phone away .",
    "so , what were you two lovebirds talking about before we got here ?",
    "there is romance in it , but it s more about a family ,  i explain , careful not to mention the predominant fatherson themes .",
    "well , you ll love it ,  he replies , locking up his car .",
    "i shriek and grab his arm as i see his fingers graze over my copy of lady chatterley s lover .",
    "i can tell that you re good , and kind , and he needs people like that to love him .",
    "you re in love ,  she whispers .",
    "people find love wherever they can .",
    "first love always hits the hardest ,  she murmurs as she rubs my arm .",
    "you have no idea how much i care about   i love you",
    "i told him that i loved him , and he did nt say it back .",
    "when you told me you loved me  i raise my hand to stop him .",
    "anything so that i do nt have to hear all the reasons why he does nt love me .",
    "when you told me you loved me ,  he resumes ,  i felt empty",
    "in that moment , i do nt think i knew if i was capable of love .",
    "what my father had shown me for years was nt love , i do nt think , it was control .",
    "i felt so undeserving to be loved by you , and for me to even tell you that i loved you , it would nt mean anything , because it would be from someone who was empty",
    "i think , in his own twisted way , he does love you",
    "i love seeing that i m pushing him right to the edge even as an orgasm is quickly building inside of me .",
    "the realtor described the neighborhood as  upandcoming ,  and nate loved the cozy feel and exposed brick .",
    "i love you , too ,  i reply as he leans in to kiss me .",
    "once such a big deal for him to say , nate now tells me he loves me regularly .",
    "every day , i find a new reason to fall more in love with you .",
    "we ve only ever loved each other as sisters .",
    "about two months ago , i got the shock of my life when my widower father , robert rowan , announced that , after four years of refusing to date , he had just met the new love of his life .",
    "after just two weeks , dad told me that he was in love , and wanted to introduce this deborah to me as soon as possible .",
    "your one true love , obviously ,  she says , looping an arm around my waist and dragging me toward the group .",
    "what re you , keeping track of my lovers or something ?",
    "of course , i do nt mind at all that emerson s taking notice of my love life , paltry though it may be .",
    "i have to fight hard from letting a dopey , lovestruck look escape across my features .",
    "maybe all this loveydovey nonsense is just in my head after all .",
    "i promise , you ll love it",
    "what is it you even love about her , dad ?",
    "i mean , you do love her ?",
    "i love how she looks .",
    "it s a place i ve come to love and depend on as a safe haven .",
    "if i m not going to get any action this weekend after all , i d better stock up on the self love every chance i get .",
    "why would he all but profess his love for you one night ?",
    "he professed his wanting to bone me ,  i correct her ,  not his love",
    "my every nerve sizzles with anticipation as emerson unlocks our motel room love nest and walks in before me .",
    "he watches as i peel open the wellloved pages .",
    "then you re going to love this ..",
    "i say with my best seductive grin .",
    "i m not much for designers or labels , but i love vintage and handmade things .",
    "i fall in love with one piece especiallya slender silver ring the bears a single pearl .",
    "that s right ,  he murmurs , his voice low and hoarse ,  i love it when you tell me what you want",
    "i love the feel of him as he fills up my mouth , the taste of him as he pulses for me .",
    "his hair is pushed away from his face , though the signature stubble i love so much is still in place .",
    "i love my grandparents , but there s definitely a lot of pressure that goes along with trying to meet their expectations .",
    "and as our parents share their first kiss as man and wife , i try my best to tell emerson one more thing with my silent , pleading eyes   i love you",
    "and as i look on , my heart breaking , i could swear his blue eyes tell me ,  i love you too",
    "they re going to love you",
    "i think i m going to love it .",
    "it s not as good as champagne in a motel room ..",
    "my heart flips over as he immediately brings up our fated night as lovers .",
    "as in my onetime brother , longlost lover , walked out of my life forever and broke my heart into a million little pieces emerson ?",
    "now you can rekindle your romance at last !",
    "a super sexy , super loaded , super intelligent gift wrapped up in an incredible person that i ve loved since i was a kid , that is .",
    "as if i did nt have enough reason to be nervous around him before , now it turns out that he s not only my longlost first love , but also a goddamn billionaire ?",
    "that makes two of us ,  he replies ,  i m expecting a report on your love life , too",
    "i d love to not make this runningafteryou thing a habit ,  i hear emerson s terse voice say from over my shoulder .",
    "i ve loved you for the better part of a decade , but we re not kids anymore , emerson .",
    "you did nt say anything , of course , but i knew you loved it .",
    "besides , i m here with my best friend and longlost lover ..",
    "who i ve been carrying a torch for almost the entire past decade , despite our asshole parents  oneday marriage .",
    "after all these years , i still love it .",
    "and if i m being honest , i still love the person who gave it to me , too .",
    "so i guess my only choice is to be the model employee , even with my oneday stepbrother and potential lover training me .",
    "someone who loved me , once",
    "loves you ,  i whisper , turning to face him ,  not loved .",
    "i love you , emerson ,  i whisper , letting those blue eyes swallow me whole .",
    "i love you too , abby ,  he says ,  but right now , i need you too much to waste another second talking about it",
    "i arch my back , knowing how much he loves to drink in the sight of me wild with needing him .",
    "i cry ,  i love you , emerson .",
    "i loved you when you were a penniless eighteenyearold and i love you now !",
    "i ve always loved you , dad .",
    "and i love you ,  he says , crossing the room tentatively toward me .",
    "abby ,  he says ,  do you love emerson as much as you did when you were a kid ?",
    "no ,  i whisper hoarsely ,  i love him so much more , now",
    "especially the people who love you more than anything",
    "get on with it , lovebirds !",
    "victoria s only thought was that he had a lovely accent and spoke perfect english .",
    "as he stared down into her lovely face , he was startled by the perfection of her features .",
    "she was graceful as her body slowly came back to consciousness and he watched in fascination as those lovely green eyes blinked and focused .",
    "lips that would look lovely begging him to kiss her , he thought .",
    "it was lovely , he thought and again he had the impulse to bury his hands in the long tresses , pushing back the small , wispy curls that framed her face .",
    "but victoria loved the other woman s spirit and vitality so she dealt with the negative side of jasmine while enjoying the fun side .",
    "that would be lovely ,  victoria replied gratefully .",
    "and as for the other , you just be yourself and he ll fall in love with you harder than you could ever imagine",
    "after she nodded , scott suggested ,  then come along darling and while you re studying , i ll dream up other lovely creations to cover those magnificent breasts with ,  he said , laughing when he received the expected blush .",
    "you look lovely ,  he said and watched her rush across the room , enjoying again her refreshing innocence .",
    "yes , that would be lovely ,  she said , laying her menu to the side and sighing with relief .",
    "she loved to cook and experiment with foods but could she compete with the gourmet meals he was obviously used to ?",
    "she loved his hair , feeling so different from hers .",
    "or had he ever been in love before ?",
    "i see you re lovely ..",
    "he was about to say breasts but changed his mind , afraid she would nt appreciate his comment ,  hands that have made this delicious meal for me and i feel honored",
    "she was obviously untutored in the art of lovemaking and he d have to take it step by step .",
    "to teach her about sex and making love and all the ways to pleasure each other .",
    "she loved to cook and it usually relaxed her .",
    "he loved to see her face respond , to feel the shivers run through her body .",
    "she loved the fact that she could move her tongue , mating with his and her body arched into his .",
    "she liked living within her means and presents were meant to be small items like a scarf or gloves , not a cell phone .",
    "i m guessing that s your new love ?",
    "he had to have some redeeming qualities if she loved him like she did .",
    "to him , she was confirming her current lover s name before proceeding and it added fuel to the fire of his increasing fury .",
    "victoria was a guidance counselor for an elementary school and loved it although she d never taken either scott or jasmine up on the offer of another blind date .",
    "they teased her unmercifully about her nunlike existence but she preferred to be alone rather than deal with the kind of pain love could inflict on a person .",
    "she d loved dharr with all her heart and soul , had shivered through her first orgasm with him and then was callously rejected , told she d sullied herself and been informed she was no longer worthy .",
    "scott , just because i m not dating , does nt give you the right to criticize my love life .",
    "he d make love to her so many ways she would nt be able to think straight .",
    "they led her down the hallway to a sunny , wonderful room filled with lovely toys for all ages .",
    "just your beauty alone is lovely to look upon ,  he replied .",
    "some of the older ladies were even wearing white gloves to their elbows which was a sweet throwback to the nineteen fifties .",
    "again , thank you for a lovely evening",
    "a small spark of anger fired inside his chest when he remembered that he would nt be the one to initiate her into the world of love making as he d wanted to so many years ago , but he would enjoy her body none the less .",
    "there was something about her , a maturity , a confidence perhaps , that only enhanced her loveliness .",
    "jeffrey and alfred were handsome and charming men who were obviously in love with their wives .",
    "she loved hearing stories about dharr and the trouble the three men got into while at oxford .",
    "by the time the meal was over , she was breathing heavily and she could barely control the need to throw herself into dharr s arms and beg him to make love to her .",
    "being around him with the children , her heart had melted , seeing his tender care and understanding to the two small human beings that were aching inside for love and security and he just naturally gave it to them .",
    "here , with victoria s clumsy hands touching him , clenching at his flesh , he was no longer the experienced lover he d prided himself on being .",
    "no , he would control this experience and would show her that he was the ultimate lover .",
    "dharr s love making was so thorough and complete , she had nothing left in her afterwards .",
    "he wanted desperately to kiss her awake , to make love to her once again .",
    "she even hated to admit that her feelings for dharr were nt hatred , but were love .",
    "and this time , it was a mature love .",
    "she loved the way he made her laugh , even when she wanted to be angry with him .",
    "and she needed to find a way to fall out of love with the man .",
    "victoria , if you do nt stop being so polite , i m going to make love to you just to make sure you re the woman i was holding in my arms a few minutes ago",
    "i love the way your body responds to my touch ,  he growled , running his hands over her shoulders and arms , then back down her back .",
    "he tucked the pillows behind his back and looked down at her lovely , pain filled eyes .",
    "just because he did nt think nasty , demeaning things , did nt mean he wanted her love .",
    "so i can tell you how much i love you .",
    "how much i need you in my life and how i have suffered for five long years , thinking you were falling in love and marrying another man because i was too stupid to claim you for my own",
    "i love you , you arrogant man ,  she giggled .",
    "no , i m in love ,  he replied and pulled her into his arms effortlessly , despite her extra pounds .",
    "as much as she loved these little guys , that pose was never good .",
    "siri could because she knew them and loved every tiny freckle on their faces .",
    "jacob , you know i love surprises ,  she lied and felt no remorse ,  but i also know that sometimes sam s surprises can be a bit scary .",
    "to the left of sam were their two dogs ,  rover  and  boy  , neither canine having a very celebrated parentage and to the right of jacob was  kitty  , a white , short haired feline that loved shedding on siri s black slacks .",
    "sam was the animal lover and any creature that crossed his path needed to be adopted and  loved  by her adorable little son .",
    "he brought home animals even when they had owners , and she had to return them , sometimes with a very sad boy on her hands because , in his mind , no one could take care of animals and give them enough love like he could .",
    "but no matter how exhausting it was , she loved them and knew she d never give them up for anything or anyone .",
    "siri was charmed by his old fashioned manners and she loved talking with him .",
    "she was painfully disappointed , not just because she loved arguing with him and laughing with him , but also because she was always so excited to see him .",
    "and she definitely loved the way he touched her .",
    "sounds lovely ,  she said , ignoring the fact that he was just assuming she d agree to dinner with him again .",
    "she knew that he liked italian and middle eastern foods , disliked beer and preferred wine , loved to exercise and teased her about her fear of being alone with him .",
    "you look lovely ,  he said a moment before he pulled her roughly into his arms , kissing her deeply and pulling her close .",
    "malik definitely was nt shy and she loved the way he held her , tormenting her with his body .",
    "as soon as his mouth was gone from her breast , she missed the intensity and wanted him back , but then he kissed her stomach and she loved that as well , the feeling almost like a tickle , but much more intense .",
    "he also loved the way she writhed against the bed covers , looking like a goddess with the desire for him shining in her beautiful eyes .",
    "he loved the way she moved instinctively against her , feeling her heat , the ecstasy of her body against his , clenching against him and driving him insane with the need to move faster .",
    "he loved the way she snuggled against him , her leg even coming up to slide against his .",
    "but mostly , they spent their time in bed , finding new ways to love each other .",
    "she never said the words , but siri was totally , completely , madly in love with this man who continued to surprise her .",
    "she came to be with him , to make love with him and enjoy his company .",
    "i know that he hates broccoli and asparagus , loves the opera and ballet and rides horses extremely well .",
    "she d trusted him with her heart , with the most intimate part of her and he d stomped on that trust , on her love .",
    "when the twins were born , they were right there helping her through every moment and she loved them for all of their support .",
    "it seemed strange that the man she d laughed with and made love to throughout all hours of the night , who was the secret father of her children was actually ruler of one of the wealthiest countries in the world .",
    "his marriage had been a necessity , one that he d carried out as an obligation , but there had been no love between him and his wife .",
    "goodness , they loved building things , she thought with a heart full of love .",
    "he might be a rat in the romance department , but these little guys represented the future of his country .",
    "the boys loved that set , thought it was so wonderful but already they were growing too big for it .",
    "she got out the pasta and whipped up their favorite meal of macaroni and cheese for dinner , adding in hot dogs which they loved , even if they did nt know the hot dogs were actually made out of tofu .",
    "and she loved it , reveled in his touch and his scent and the way he felt against her .",
    "her fingers had always loved to touch him , to feel his heated skin underneath her fingertips .",
    "at that moment , it happened to be her breast which was already sensitive from his previous lovemaking .",
    "she loved the satiny feel of him , the amazing texture and musky , male scent as she kissed and tasted his ridged stomach muscles .",
    "she d loved another man ?",
    "he would have sworn that she d loved him all those years ago but maybe he d only been hoping that were the case .",
    "no charm , no kissing , no making love ever again .",
    "she did nt even hope that he loved her , just that she had meant something to him .",
    "he d married her only days after holding her in his arms and making love to her until she cried out with her pleasure .",
    "the boys would love a dinner night out",
    "it was like an erogenous zone outside of the norm and she hated that he remembered how much she loved to be caressed on her back .",
    "i loved the pink marble .",
    "or to add a bit of romance to his day ?",
    "she remembered that scent , remembered how much she d loved it .",
    "they d never made love in the kitchen .",
    "well , there were a few things but siri did nt think  faster  or  please  would keep her safe from his lovemaking .",
    "they would love to have the hardwood floors to race their cars along .",
    "he wanted her so badly and she was here , willing and soft and warm and lovely .",
    "he lifted up slightly and looked around , astounded that he was actually making love to this woman in an empty house .",
    "as siri came back down to earth , she could nt help but marvel at what an amazing lover malik was .",
    "they would laugh at how inept their husbands or lovers were , how insensitive .",
    "she was so in love with the man she could barely think at work .",
    "they d purchased that house last week , the one where they d made love on the floor in front of the windows , and siri could nt believe how quickly he d made things happen .",
    "jacob and samuel loved all the open space , the new play area they had in a small , fenced in area of the back yard and the play room filled with new toys and different games to play .",
    "she d love that material so much , she d added it to her inventory and it was going to be the front cover specialty for the christmas catalog .",
    "and they especially loved having a dad that came home to them every night , played with them , showed them how to do different things and taught them endless new ideas .",
    "the part they loved the most , he never ran out of answers for their questions .",
    "the result was a mural of a jungle scene on one wall , a desert on another and a loft type sleeping area with a  hideout  below where they loved to hide from their mother .",
    "he was with the boys until their bed times and then he d pull her into his arms and make love to her until she fell asleep .",
    "there was a fantastic nanny who watched over the boys and both of them loved her , eagerly running to greet her each morning after breakfast to find out what she was going to teach them during each day .",
    "she loved him even more for his patience with her questions and helping her understand why he was doing certain things .",
    "siri loved the food and the boys thought it tasted better than the original .",
    "malik walked into the house and siri s heart swelled with love for the man when she noticed his eyes immediately looking for her , and then noticed his shoulders relaxing when he found her in the front room , obviously waiting for him .",
    "he d thought he d loved her before , but that was nothing compared to how he felt about her now .",
    "she would have sworn that he loved being with the boys , and she definitely enjoyed having him around , even though she d fought it hard at first .",
    "and why , why , why did she have to fall in love with a man like him ?",
    "they boys loved talking with him , telling him all that they d learned with their new nanny that day and asking him questions to show her the following day that they were on top of their lessons .",
    "she loved the teasing , not used to this from him .",
    "he was disgusted that he d allowed the debates to go on this long when the woman he loved was too far away for him to care for and protect , much less understand .",
    "i loved you back then , but i d been with you so much during the time we were together , i d become out of touch with what was happening at home .",
    "you have been the only woman i ve ever loved and even my exwife knew that i was nt emotionally involved with the relationship .",
    "she would have loved you !",
    "i love you ,  he said as he kissed her gently .",
    "i love you for all the little things you ve done for me",
    "he looked down at the woman he d loved for so many years and smiled .",
    "so if you do nt come out tonight , then you re not going to be able to see these beauties for another month and i know you re gon na love these guys",
    "he knew he d piqued her interest with that comment and she hesitated only briefly because if there was one thing in this world she loved besides her father it was horses .",
    "you re going to love these guys , rachel .",
    "she d seen him in action too many times over the years , spying on him from the loft in the stables or from the rose garden , from an empty stall or in various places where she could see him with his lady loves .",
    "rachel loved horses , loved riding and just being around the strong , gentle creatures .",
    "oh , i would love to win all the time .",
    "you used to love to ride .",
    "and i used to love watching you ride .",
    "his body was already hard and aching , wanting to pull her against him , to make love to this woman so thoroughly that she would nt remember any of the men in her past .",
    "john smiled at his lovely but oblivious daughter .",
    "that startled her because she loved her father , never wanted to hurt him .",
    "she was even lovelier than he d imagined and he wanted to bend down and kiss her , to taste her and feel her wiggle underneath him .",
    "after dreaming such vivid scenes of him making love to her she felt stunned to see him in the flesh like this .",
    "she looked like she d just made love with passionate abandon and he had to close his eyes or lose that control again .",
    "when she turned the corner in the path and headed out of sight , rais realized that he d just been standing there like a lovesick idiot while she rode away .",
    "the ones you used to bring out to your house and make love to in the stables or near the rose garden ?",
    "she knew she was close to giving in , to throwing caution to the wind and begging him to make love to her despite the fears that were always lurking in the back of her mind .",
    "you re a very experienced lover , rais .",
    "are you really going to stand there and tell me that the only reason you felt what you did was because i m more experienced than your previous lovers ?",
    "i can honestly say that you re significantly more experienced than all of my past lovers combined",
    "she wondered how he worked out and would love to talk to him about his days , find out more what it was like to rule dunari and all the problems he faced , but she did nt think he would take her questions seriously .",
    "was he actually making love to her in his mind out here by the corral ?",
    "you do nt act like you re terrified of me , unless i m trying to make love to you",
    "if you d wear something other than a shirt that is too small for you , and one that draws my eyes to that black lace bra you re wearing , by the way , then i would nt always be trying to make love to you",
    "help me understand why i should nt try and make love to the woman i ve wanted for so long i ca nt remember a time when i did nt want you in my bed",
    "so all of your old lovers meant so much to you that you re still with them ?",
    "you keep referring to my old lovers , but that assumption is nt accurate , rais",
    "i used to love just laying in the garden and smelling the roses .",
    "we re not going to have sex today because you ve had too much wine , but very soon , i m going to make love to you",
    "and you re not going to lie to me and tell me that you do nt want me to make love to you , right ?",
    "the only way to progress further with what we re doing is for me to rip that shirt off of you and view those very lovely breasts that i want desperately to see once again .",
    "i know you will be exceptionally lovely friday night",
    "because that would defeat the purpose of punishments , my love",
    "she loved the way he touched her , the electrifying way she felt in his arms .",
    "she shifted her hips , adjusting to him and he loved the way her eyes brightened once again .",
    "she did nt go home until sunday evening , at which time , he d come back with her , even coming into her apartment and made love to her one more time in her own bed before he left her to return to dunari for meetings .",
    "i would love to see you in the dresses i sent you .",
    "i chose those dresses out of several other options because i thought they were something you would like and would look lovely on you",
    "i would love to see you in those dresses , or more specifically , i would love to take you out of those dresses , slowly and with a great attention to detail .",
    "i d like to see you try and resist me now that you know what an incredible lover i am",
    "i would love to show you my home",
    "she stared at her phone , wanting to text him and tell him that she had nt been about to say love  but she did nt want to get into that .",
    "was he teasing her about her almost love  comment or just about seeing her soon ?",
    "i ve already given her the dates for my current set of events so i have her booked , but i m sure she d love your business as well",
    "but in your case , if you re sleeping with the guy , you re in love with him so it s not tacky , it s very sweet and romantic .",
    "she had no idea how long she sat there staring at the empty doorway but her mind had a very hard time trying to wrap itself around the idea of being in love with rais .",
    "she was still mulling over the idea that she was in love with rais .",
    "they d known each other for so long ..",
    "she did nt love him , she told herself firmly .",
    "love would mean caring and being emotionally invested .",
    "as she made her way to each of the vendors for friday s event , she thought about what derrick had said , her mind going over and over the possibility that she was in love with rais .",
    "the whole love  and end of relationship  issues were not going to intrude for the next seventytwo hours , she told herself firmly .",
    "and you will love every moment of it",
    "i m already having a problem because we re lovers and you re also a client .",
    "that she loved him too much to lose him ?",
    "she knew she was in trouble , knew that she was in love with rais .",
    "a silly love song was going through her mind and she wanted to surprise rais tonight .",
    "she could nt believe how much better she felt now that her fear of intimacy was gone , not to mention feeling so much love for rais .",
    "she loved her dad , but this was a completely different feeling .",
    "but then , she d probably always been in love with rais .",
    "i love the way you respond so willingly ,  lila purred , feeling his response and happily assuming it was because of her suggestion .",
    "he was a consummate lover and competitor who played to win .",
    "she d stupidly translated those into words of love and commitment .",
    "sleep in the bed where she and rais had made love ?",
    "he might not have been explicit , but she should have read between the lines and known he was in love with her !",
    "i ve loved you for so long i ca nt even remember when my feelings for you changed from friendship and brotherly affection , to something significantly deeper",
    "i ve loved you for so long it s been almost painful at times .",
    "you ve loved me for eight years ?",
    "that s why i had to leave , because i loved you so much and you just kept bringing those other women around .",
    "i promise , i ll love you so much you ll be begging for mercy ,  he promised her .",
    "she d love to have a whole houseful of children one day .",
    "she now wore it pinned on top of her head but those soft , wispy tendrils framing her face told him that she still had the lovely , silky texture .",
    "he wanted this lovely woman .",
    "as much as she would love to sit and chat with him , find out where he had been for the last ten years and how he had been , she could nt sit here in this beautiful suite next to him .",
    "really , i d love to find out what s happened with you over the past ten years ,  she said and stood up , pulling her hand out of his as she took a step backwards .",
    "you ll love it ,  she said and spun around to get him a cup .",
    "when his eyes took in her lovely appearance , his body reacted to the soft blush that stained her pale cheeks .",
    "it was nt much of a view , but the conservative , cotton teeshirt hugged her breasts just enough to tell him that she would be more than a handful when he finally freed those lovely breasts from the restraint of her plain , cotton bra .",
    "both of them were completely dedicated to each other and it was a love that ella hoped for herself someday .",
    "that s not really what is going to happen , ella ,  he said softly , his hands sliding up her waist , stopping just short of cupping those lovely , full breasts .",
    "ella stared at the door , gripping the love seat behind her .",
    "zayn looked down at the incredibly lovely woman in the cheap , thin sundress that , nonetheless , looked astoundingly alluring on her slender frame .",
    "he inquired , but he specifically remembered how much she loved pasta .",
    "you know i love italian ,  she came back .",
    "this is lovely ,  she said , pretending that the cost would nt be an issue .",
    "you know how much i love pasta and i ve already overindulged .",
    "she d loved baking cookies , but she had nt done that in over four years .",
    "well , now that you brought it up , i loved making cookies and other baked goods .",
    "i really loved dinner tonight ,  she said , wishing he would just take her back into his arms and make her feel wonderful again .",
    "he put one arm under the small of her back and the other arm was braced above her head against the arm of the love seat .",
    "with her feet barely on the floor , she felt zayn hold her gently against his side as he tossed the pillows off of her love seat .",
    "zayn was the most incredible lover , she thought with a silly grin on her face .",
    "besides , she just loved spending time with him and every moment seemed like a precious gift .",
    "why could nt she just fall in love with him ?",
    "she shook her head frantically , her mind remembering how quickly their touch could degenerate into a lust so intense that she d made love to this man on a love seat !",
    "he d often wondered over the years if his memory had given him an altered picture of just how lovely she was but in reality , his memory had done the exact opposite .",
    "some of her temper suddenly dissipated as her heart filled with love for this little man .",
    "she loved that little boy so much but maybe max needed a father in his life ?",
    "i was nt in pain , my little love .",
    "she smiled in the darkness , feeling the love for this little guy almost overwhelm her .",
    "she would have loved to share some of those late night ear infections , she thought as she sipped her coffee .",
    "he wanted to make love to her .",
    "he could show her his private suite , rooms which would also become her own , and make love to her on satin sheets , or under the stars on his private balcony .",
    "he looked down at her beautiful features , astonished that she was lovely even without makeup .",
    "he was actually torn between the options of tossing this woman over his shoulder and making love to her and the equally appealing idea of getting to know his son .",
    "zayn , i love wearing jeans",
    "and i love seeing you in them",
    "she d love to wear something more feminine and only wore jeans because they were comfortable and convenient .",
    "especially when she looked so lovely .",
    "he loved his school teachers as well and she was nt jealous of those women .",
    "she loved her son , but was she ready to share him ?",
    "she was finally shown to a large , beautiful suite of rooms where there was a large bedroom , a gorgeous sitting room , even a lovely conservatory filled with strange and exotic plants .",
    "do nt make love to my wife ?",
    "but something inside of her simply could nt take that next step and give herself permission to make love with him .",
    "there were many moments she wanted him to ignore her resistance and just make love to her until they were both breathless .",
    "so when she pushed backwards , he was suddenly inside of her , her heat wrapping around him like a hot , wet glove .",
    "he d made love to her so many times and in so many ways , she was astounded by his endurance and creativity .",
    "as she watched and listened , ella knew instantly that she d fallen in love with this man .",
    "it seemed almost ridiculous to think that she could have fallen in love with a man she d known for such a short time , but there was nt any other explanation .",
    "i will not charge any of you with treason , but you need to understand why i love this woman .",
    "ella did nt know how he d learned some of that , but her heart swelled with love for the man who was defending her so righteously .",
    "and she loved him even more for that show of support .",
    "they risked their employment and their futures because they love and respect you .",
    "i love you ,  she whispered .",
    "he laughed derisively as he said ,  i did nt know that i d be going through three weeks of hell , watching you walk around , taunting me with your lovely body and wanting you more than i ve ever wanted any other woman in my life .",
    "i love you ,  she said , then held her breath , waiting for his reaction .",
    "she loved this man , could nt get enough of him and wanted to spend the rest of her life making him happy .",
    "in my old age , i fear i am unable to provide more than love and kisses , which is nt up to the task any longer .",
    "they will give her the love she needs .",
    "he  s a great lover .",
    "dharr walked forward , his experienced eyes noting other features in the lovely woman that further piqued his interest .",
    "her soft , green eyes were dreamy , staring off into space and her full , sensuous lips were slightly parted , as if she were thinking of her lover .",
    "his eyes took in her lovely face , her perfect skin and green eyes that looked like soft moss after an early spring rain shower .",
    "that would be lovely ,  she sighed and was thrilled when he sat down across from her .",
    "what does a lovely woman like you do during the daytime hours ?",
    "pink implies romance and femininity .",
    "i would love to teach children ,  she said .",
    "she was exceptionally beautiful but he knew that if he  d had a teacher this lovely , he would have studied much harder , just to impress her .",
    "she suspected that making love with this man would be spectacular but she couldn  t diminish the potential by being silly and childish , she reminded herself .",
    "he didn  t want this lovely , luscious woman to have principles .",
    "greek history is also amazing but i love roman history the best .",
    "her whole body had forgotten her missed meeting and was now focused on her previous intent of seducing this man , having him initiate her into the world of love making .",
    "she hated her coffee black but hewasn  t sure why she drank it that way , she loved history , she had a rebellious streak that would be exciting to tame and she was physically attracted to him .",
    "i have no idea ,  he said softly , his eyes not even looking at the flower but more on the expression of joy on her lovely face .",
    "electra grimaced and moved on to the next lovely , delicate bloom .",
    "all she wanted to do was make love with this man and experience the magic she was sure he could give her with his touch .",
    "i want to understand why you chose me to be your first lover ,  he said .",
    "he was too passionate of a lover to settle for simply one woman .",
    "she loved every moment of it .",
    "and when she dreamed about him at night and their one night together , she just put that up to having experienced superior lovemaking technique .",
    "dharr , i would love to meet you but i  m not sure what time i  ll be able to get away ,  she lied .",
    "it  s about time you had a little romance in your life .",
    "he looked exactly like any romantic movie portrayed the man the morning after a wonderful night of making love .",
    "it was still thrilling and she loved walking hand in hand with dharr , asking him questions about his previous visits to the spectacular city and all the various other places he  d visited throughout his lifetime .",
    "after a lovely lunch at a sidewalk cafe , he announced ,  now that we  ve been to all of your choices , the afternoon is mine",
    "she said , frustrated that he wouldn  t pull her into his arms and make love to her .",
    "he quickly followed with his own release , then gently picked her up and carried her to the bedroom where he continued to make love to her for the next three hours .",
    "as addicted to dharr as she knew she had become , she also was addicted to the thrill of her position and the laughter of the children , not to mention the love of seeing their fascination with the world and with learning .",
    "but then she walked into the lovely log cabin and saw him talking on a cell phone .",
    "oh , no you don  t , lovely lady ,  he said and pulled her more firmly against him , rolling over so her soft body was pinned underneath him .",
    "she took only a few minutes in the shower since the warm water and scented soap rubbing along her body only reminded her of how incredible dharr  s lovemaking turned out to be .",
    "even a shower now was turning her on and all she could think about was how fast she could get back to him , be with him , make love with him .",
    "they ate , talked , skied and made love for the rest of the we ekend .",
    "their time together was always special and filled with romance and heated passion .",
    "electra looked around the room again , noting the romantic slant to the decorating , the extra big bed and all the lovely skin lotions that had been in the bathroom when she  d arrived for the first time six weeks ago .",
    "dharr was instantly erect and all he wanted was to get this conversation over with so he could toss her back onto the bed and make love to her .",
    "i have a lover who thinks she can order me around ,  he said softly , pulling her leg up and rubbing his thumbs against her instep .",
    "the caption read ,  who  s the king  s new love interest ?",
    "the article had been dated just yesterday and the reporter was saying how the king  s lover was still a mystery woman .",
    "i wanted to date and be excited about my first kiss and my first lover .",
    "you were never mean to them , and loved having them around .",
    "oh , i know you occasionally tried to sneak out and experience a little of their romance .",
    "i loved you so much but after your father died , you were in so much pain and were lashing out at anyone and everyone , including yourself .",
    "i  m in a plane going who knows where with a man i thought i ..",
    "she was about to say love but stopped herself in time ,  admired and respected but now i find out he  s a stranger .",
    "you were my ward and it is now common knowledge that we were lovers .",
    "all the dreams she  d built up during the nights she couldn  t sleep because she  d been thinking of him , weaving fantasies about what a wonderful life they could have together and how much she loved him , were all shattered now .",
    "dharr didn  t love her , he only wanted to marry her out of obligation .",
    "she couldn  t marry a man who didn  t love her .",
    "she was in love with dharr !",
    "she was in love with the man who had been making her miserable all her life .",
    "how could she not have fallen in love with him , she asked herself when she thought about all they  d done together .",
    "she would not marry a man who didn  t love her .",
    "love was the basis for a long lasting , satisfying and fulfilling marriage .",
    "that looks lovely ,  she said to one vendor who was displaying several long , colorful robes .",
    "but she wouldn  t fall into a marriage with a man who didn  t love her .",
    "no matter how much she loved him , she thought sadly .",
    "this one was more comprehensive and started off with the ideal that the man she married would love her completely .",
    "she loved him , dammit !",
    "everyone had loved that excuse , loving her even more for that .",
    "you know she loves me too , don  t you ?",
    "since that  s not the case , and you  ve mentioned seeing electra in london , then she probablyis hidden away somewhere trying to work out of being in love with you",
    "once she gives her heart , it is well and truly in love .",
    "her determination to fall out of love with this man was already disintegrating .",
    "at the bottom of the long list , she  d written ,  great lover  .",
    "i  m surprised great lover  is at the bottom of the list .",
    "there are abouttwenty other things on the list that you love about me",
    "the list says love about dharr  ,  he challenged .",
    "if you were , you  d admit that you  re in love with me",
    "perhaps because i love you and not having you by my side or at least knowing where you are has driven me insane this past week ?",
    "and you  re going to marry me in one week and you  ll say you love me every day until and after that time",
    "she loved her job , but more importantly , she loved the security of the palace .",
    "sheik hassan bin faisiraltakar watched in fascination as the lovely woman walked back and forth across his office , mumbling something under her breath before scribbling on his note pad .",
    "but after several moments , his curiosity got the better of him and he wanted to know what could possibly be troubling a woman as lovely as this little one .",
    "beautiful women were lovely to have around , but not during business hours .",
    "she was achingly lovely even with no color in her skin and her lips being bitten painfully .",
    "deep inside , she accepted that she truly loved her new job .",
    "this was a sheik , a ruler who had a great deal of responsibility and did nt need her puppy love to get in the way of his daily routines .",
    "her heart raced as she pictured hassan slowly undressing her and making love to her .",
    "she loved cooking but since her promotion , she d been at the palace until way after dinner , sometimes arguing with hassan about one policy or another and debating her opinion against his own .",
    "however much she loved the desert and the brutal beauty of it , the amazing life that scurried throughout the desolate sands , it was time to move on .",
    "we loved experimenting with different types of foods and meals",
    "over and over again as he made love to her while she was curled up next to him .",
    "she loved the fact that he was offering her help , that he cared enough to stop her from leaving .",
    "with a groan , he shifted slightly , changing his position subtly from imprisoning , to capturing , shifting just so and he loved her gasp of pleasure and the way her body arched up into his , pressing her softness more firmly against him .",
    "his hand moved down her body , cupping her bottom and pressing her more closely against him and he rubbed her , mimicking the movements of making love and he swore when he realized they were both fully clothed .",
    "secondly , the blush that s covering your very lovely cheeks is giving me a whole different story",
    "he d made love to her until she could nt think any longer , was begging him for release .",
    "that s my right , my love .",
    "he pushed open an ornate door that led to a lovely room filled with gauzy fabrics and long sofas .",
    "she loved the way he touched her and ..",
    ".stop it , she told herself .",
    "time to concentrate on work and not on making love with this very amazing man .",
    "i love it when my fiance is so prompt and attentive .",
    "there was another suit in the closet , this one in a lovely shade of brown .",
    "until then , just know that i ll be in my suite thinking about you , and thinking about all the different ways i want to make love to you and only your stubbornness is keeping us apart",
    "as she twirled around , she knew that she was in love with this dress .",
    "i love the way you feel ,  he said softly as his hand pressed her leg against his hip , moving into place .",
    "she could nt be  the other woman  and she definitely would nt be a mistress to a man she ..",
    "the woman he loved , the one who drove him crazy with her opinions that were so opposite his own but that he wanted in his life for the rest of his days was trying to run away from him and would nt even ask him for help .",
    "i think i heard you say that you love me",
    "i love you and you re making me a mad man by telling me that you re going to leave me and put yourself in danger just to keep me from being in danger .",
    "and you will be safe , rest assured of that , my love",
    "you have no idea what i m capable of doing , my love .",
    "but all she could think about was ,  i love you",
    "i love you too ,  hassan replied , bending down to kiss her gently while his large hand covered his son s sweet head .",
    "this was the man she d thought herself in love with as a teenager .",
    "you really are lovely ,  he said , his voice husky .",
    "you do nt want me but i m sure there are many women who would love your ..",
    ".attentions ,  she said breathlessly .",
    "are you trying to tell me that you are not one of those women who would love my ..",
    "she hated this man and had left the security and love of her family and created an image for herself of a completely unacceptable wife in order to escape marrying him .",
    "sarila loved dancing and had been attending these dances for the past two years religiously , forming a tightly knit group of friends who were equally enraptured with the dance scene in los angeles .",
    "she loved the challenge of keeping up with his lead and following through with his moves .",
    "she loves your class so much .",
    "i love food and you re definitely tempting me but i m a teacher and we never really have any time off .",
    "he watched the way her long , muscular legs carried her quickly out of the restaurant and her lovely breasts pushed against the material of her shirt .",
    "she knew her parents loved each other desperately but she did nt understand why they fought so much .",
    "for one , heart stopping moment , the idea of taking a break with him , laughing and talking with him sounded lovely .",
    "and she also wanted someone who would be faithful and love her the same way she was willing to love a man .",
    "you love women too much from what i remember",
    "what could possibly bring you more color to those lovely cheeks and sparks to your eyes more than the wind and sun ?",
    "she just wanted him to respect her enough so he would nt fall in love with someone else while still betrothed to her .",
    "since that was nt the case , he knew he would have to keep his hands , and every other body part , away from the lovely , sexy sarila .",
    "i m a very generous lover ,  he replied .",
    "i m sure you re a terrific lover .",
    "she knew they loved but their fights were loud and uncompromising .",
    "a few had stuck around to get to know her , but they d ended up as friends and had never crossed over to lover .",
    "make love , sleep around , have sex , whatever the term and i m sure there are several that are more indecent ,  he said .",
    "sarila loved the speed and the freedom the jet ski allowed and she challenged kasar to a race , which he easily won but it was so much fun to race around as if there were no cares or concerns in the world .",
    "and since you were so considerate to fill up the closet with these lovely dresses , i decided to pamper myself",
    "your parents love you very much .",
    "i love to cook although i m not very good at it ,  she said , ignoring his statement just as he had her question .",
    "she loved the way he made her feel and her arms instantly moved to wrap around his neck as soon as he bent down to kiss her again .",
    "and whoever had been her previous lover had nt taught her much in the way of lovemaking .",
    "and then make love with her until neither one of them cared if the rest of the world crumbled outside their bedroom , he added grimly .",
    "kasar would be the ultimate lover , she thought .",
    "i want to pull you into my arms , carry you downstairs to my bedroom , tear off those clothes and make love with you .",
    "she could experience what real lovemaking was like before she had to go home again to her cold , barren existence .",
    "as a lover , she could never ask for anyone better than kasar .",
    "kasar had woken her several times during the night and made love with her , teaching her so much she had nt even imagined .",
    "he was the ultimate lover , she suspected .",
    "kasar was a wonderful lover , but he was also demanding and thorough .",
    "her body was sated with his lovemaking and she was seriously wondering why she had fought against this for so long .",
    "i love the way you blush when you re trying to be sophisticated ,  he said and ran a finger over her cheeks .",
    "the waiter arrived and sarila tried to jump up out of his lap , embarrassed to be caught in such a loverlike position .",
    "they spent the next week making love , sleeping and stopping by whatever port they were passing by .",
    "on those days , they would shop and leave right after dusk , falling into bed to make love until the morning .",
    "just make love with me ,  she said .",
    "they made love until the early hours of the morning .",
    "she wanted to love kasar and be loved in return .",
    "they d never spoken of their feelings for each other but she knew that she was completely , desperately in love with him .",
    "there was no way she could have made love with him and not been in love as well .",
    "they seemed to love each other when they were nt fighting .",
    "their love even seemed very passionate .",
    "that s what is important ,  she said and gazed at her daughter with unconditional love only a parent could offer .",
    "after a night of making love with kasar , she was too tired for that so she simply pulled the coverlet over her legs and closed her eyes .",
    "oh , that would be lovely ,  sarila said and stepped back to let the woman into the room .",
    "or more specifically , her mother who loved shopping and took pride in never wearing the same outfit twice .",
    "he pulled her slightly off to the side and bent to whisper in her ear ,  you look incredibly lovely ,  he said , his breath warm on her cheek and sending shivers down her spine .",
    "she did nt know how to be a good wife and her love for him simply would nt be enough to sustain them .",
    "come to my room tonight and i ll show you ..",
    "she hesitated , about to say  how much i love you  but stopped herself just in time .",
    "if kasar did nt want her , then she would have to get over him and find someone else to love .",
    "we love each other , dear",
    "she d never understood her parents  relationship but had always known that they loved each other .",
    "now her respect grew for both her mother , who loved her father enough to anger him when he needed it , and her father , who made sure he never hurt his family with his temper and work frustrations .",
    "he has always been satisfied with a good , old fashioned yelling match , then he s a happy man again , able to live and laugh and love",
    "she loved the fact that they had arranged dinners and breakfasts with her old friends and it was wonderful to catch up with them , meet their children and husbands or talk about their work lives .",
    "they made love until neither was able to speak .",
    "she would go back to california , to her teaching and her lonely life with her friends that would never become boyfriends and kasar would marry some awful woman who could never love him as much as she did .",
    "sarila knew she loved him but would nt be satisfied living her life through her husband .",
    "your kasar is quite the lover , i m guessing",
    "you re in love with him ,  she said as if that made everything okay .",
    "that you re in love with him ?",
    "or that you ve been making love with him every night ?",
    "he s in love with you , sarila .",
    "he looks like he s in love with you ,  she said , emphasizing each word .",
    "the idea of declaring her love for him was too terrifying when he d given her no indication that her feelings were reciprocated .",
    "he knew that she loved him .",
    "but he d tried , both physically by making love to her with everything he had , as well as intellectually by showing her how she could make a difference in their people s lives through a better education .",
    "be brave and know that you are loved in return !",
    "i know you re not interested in marriage right now , but if you ever do , in the future ..",
    "she stumbled , looking down at her hands that were twisting in front of her ,  well , i love you ,  she shouted , then looked away .",
    "i love you too ,  he said and kissed her again .",
    "do you think your father would mind if i carried you back to your room to make love to you ?",
    "i love you ,  he said and smiled down at her .",
    "why did you have to wait until the last minute to tell me you loved me ?",
    "only if you ll love me and give me lots of babies ,  she confirmed .",
    "and with such a lovely lady ?",
    "i d never argue with such loveliness ,  jasim said but there was an edge to his voice as he replied , betraying the truth behind his words .",
    "she loved him but did nt understand his desire to pay for an elaborate wedding they could ill afford .",
    "did nt he know that kids needed love and security much more than they needed fancy clothes and designer shoes ?",
    "any woman who describes her almost fiance as nice  is not in love with him",
    "what do you know of love ?",
    "but i hope the woman i choose to marry will indeed love me to the point of counting the minutes until i arrive at her side",
    "but the man i marry will be so in love with me that he will be counting the minutes when i m away ,  she said .",
    "but perhaps he is not the love of your life ?",
    "she d sit across from him and be reminded of all the wonderful attributes she loved about him and that would reassure herself of her life s plan .",
    "it had been a productive evening and he wanted to spend the rest of the night making love to this shy woman sitting so stiffly across from him .",
    "lovely ,  he said , rubbing the silky strands between his fingers .",
    "did nt she love him ?",
    "we make love one night , you insult me by sending me money as if i were some sort of hired help to be paid off , now you think i m pregnant so you kidnap me and threaten to take this theoretical child away from me",
    "we met and made love , both of us involved and neither one remembering about contraceptives , i had a nice evening and wanted to show you how much so i sent you a gift .",
    "she will also be educated in the best schools and loved",
    "there was a lovely table filled with white roses , candle light and silver covered plates .",
    "dani did nt want to eat in silence , so she relented and spoke of her children , the classes and what parts of the work she liked , loved or hated .",
    "alea greeted , waking dani up out of her comfortable dream where she was making love to kalil and he was professing his intense love for her .",
    "the room really was lovely and the courtyard was filled with beautiful flowers and a trickling fountain that soothed the soul .",
    "you look lovely ,  he said , taking her hands in his .",
    "i agree , and i would love to continue this conversation but unfortunately , i am expected in another meeting .",
    "but he d wanted just one kiss that night , hoping for an opportunity on another trip to london to sample more of the lovely danielle s charms .",
    "one was a pantsuit in a soft blue with embroidery at the bottom of one and the other was a lovely shade of pink with a fitted jacket and white silk shirt .",
    "there were others that were still in the bags and all of them still had the tags on them indicating that they were not borrowed from some other lover of kalil s .",
    "this is also lovely ,  she said and carried what dani could now see was a strapless , satin sheath .",
    "there were five other evening dresses , all of them just as lovely but still very sexy .",
    "you look lovely ,  he said softly , walking up to stand in front of her .",
    "i thought all women loved to have new outfits",
    "there was also asparagus with a tangy lemon sauce and a lovely garnish that looked too lovely to even move from the side of the plate .",
    "i just do nt understand how a woman as lovely as you could possibly be untouched at the age of twenty six",
    "i would simply order you into bed so i could make love to you all night , just as we did three weeks ago",
    "she asked , amazed at the lovely blooms at her fingertips .",
    "how lovely ,  she said , smiling as she took the offered flower .",
    "we re going to make love tonight , danielle ,  he said with absolute confidence .",
    "she asked , wondering where the sensitive , caring lover of the night before had disappeared to .",
    "you look lovely when you re angry , danielle .",
    "she could also say that she d fallen in love with a man who could nt possibly love her and it more than she dreamed it could .",
    "then you can go marry your lovely lina who ,  dani stopped and shook her head again ,  and i ll be the woman who gets to visit her child whenever there is time",
    "she was nt going to bring up the fact that lina was in love with his brother .",
    "jalla ,  she said , stopping the lovely woman in the middle of the hallway and looking around to make sure she was nt going to be overheard ,  when are you going to admit that you re not in love with kalil ?",
    "of course i m not in love with him .",
    "nor is he in love with me .",
    "but you love him ,  she whispered ,  and that is something that should thrive",
    "because you re in love with jasim ?",
    "i was just hoping that ..",
    "well , you know , that maybe you and kalil would fall in love and be happy together",
    "yes , i m in love with him but that is only half of the equation .",
    "the people are in love with you .",
    "there could be no love without trust .",
    "she moved automatically into his arms without hesitation and kalil closed his eyes and fell asleep , contemplating making love to her in a few hours .",
    "when i checked this morning , it looked absolutely lovely .",
    "the other was the father of the man she loved with all her heart and could do more harm than she cared to think about .",
    "i love it , pattia !",
    "it s incredibly lovely as well ,  she answered .",
    "two assistants helped dani into the dress and veil and she saw herself in the mirror and was in love with the dress .",
    "dani asked , thinking the whole ceremony sounded lovely and very quaint .",
    "if jalla was in love with kalil s brother , surely it would nt be too awful of a situation for the two to put the contract aside and marry each other .",
    "that sounds lovely ,  she said , looking down at her hands .",
    "know that my former fiancee is in love with my brother ?",
    "could it be that you are in love with me and afraid to allow those feelings to flourish ?",
    "you love having people fawn over you ,  she sniffed , wishing she could hold back the tears that were threatening to fall .",
    "i love you as well ,  he said , turning her to face him just as a tear slipped over her lower lashes .",
    "i love you with all my heart ,  he said .",
    "if you loved me , you d really want to marry me .",
    "i love you too ,  she said as he picked her up in his arms and carried her down the palace hallways toward their rooms .",
    "but even now , as she listened to kalil express his words of love and vows of security and care , she felt more married now when he expressed his own vows than during the traditional vows that she d always thought would bind her to her husband .",
    "i love you with all my heart ,  she said in arabic back to him .",
    "within moments , her arms were filled with lovely , fragrant flowers of all shapes and sizes .",
    "later that night as she lay naked in the security of kalil s arms , she whispered ,  i love you ,  again , then was greeted by the words and his strong arms closing around her .",
    "the lovely , enticing view of the woman s breast captured his attention .",
    "not to mention the excitement in her lovely , expressive eyes when she bit her full , lower lip .",
    "in this position , she was currently too occupied looking around the corner , but he could see right down that lovely dress to those breasts that his hands suddenly ached to hold and explore .",
    "he had no desire to make love to any of those people .",
    "there are so many other women who would love to be in my place .",
    "he d led her out into a lovely courtyard filled with fragrant flowers and lush greenery .",
    "shanelle knew there were beautiful blonds and sultry redheads somewhere in the palace , all who would dearly love to be chosen as the next baby maker .",
    "not with her writhing like this , her eyes begging him to take her , make love to her .",
    "it s very possible ,  he said and moved deeper inside of her , closing his eyes as her tight heat wrapped around him like a tight , hot glove .",
    "over and over , malik had made love to her .",
    "it was lovely with elaborate place settings and a delicious smelling buffet set out with steaming dishes and gorgeous fruit .",
    "she did nt want to beg , but she was quickly reaching the point where she would beg him to make love to her again .",
    "he was trying to respect her need for space , for romance .",
    "and they d just made love like there was no tomorrow !",
    "you re just too afraid to admit that you re in love with me .",
    "i love you , damn it !",
    "of course i love you .",
    "i ve loved you since that first night when you yelled at me for being in the wrong place !",
    "shanelle , if love between a husband and wife is nt the issue , please tell me what is",
    "i do nt love you and you do nt love me .",
    "it takes months of knowing someone before we can really love each other .",
    "she did nt understand that love , but it was there every time they spoke to one another .",
    "and now that he understood the big issue , he was just that much more in love with her .",
    "she was in love and she was thrilled with the future .",
    "tabitha maccomber was incredibly lovely but also the only woman who had tricked him so completely , gotten under his skin and then made a fool of him .",
    "i m guessing there were many women already clamoring for your pathetic brand of romance",
    "we re going to make love , you and i .",
    "she reacted without thought to his kiss , her body glorying in the amazing feel of his hands , his lips and his tongue as he showed her again how wonderful and skilled he was as a lover .",
    "he asked , pulling a map out of a small glove compartment of his motorcycle .",
    "tabitha smiled , her mind instantly forming a romantic scene where he carried her off on his motorcycle to his country cabin and the two of them fell madly in love .",
    "it was a lovely spring afternoon and she did nt mind sitting out in the sun for the few minutes while she waited , sure that her father would be along any moment .",
    "that sounds lovely ,  she said , smiling up at him .",
    "this is lovely ,  she said , taking the blanket he handed her and spreading it out over the grass .",
    "i love you so much .",
    "but she also knew that , once her father got to know nikolai , he would love him just as much as she did .",
    "she was in love and , although she knew love would nt put food on the table , she was confident enough that they would never starve .",
    "the feelings tabitha had stirred within him had not been fantasy , but perhaps the idea of love for him was just that , unreal and never would be .",
    "we re in love and i m going to find him and tell him that i do nt care about your approval .",
    "she d trusted him , fell in love with him and finding out that he was nothing like the man she d thought he was had been too painful .",
    "she hated the idea , but love had nt worked out for her .",
    "walking into the luxurious hotel room that was to be their first stop on a two week long vacation , she stood in the doorway , horror dawning on her face as she watched her groom in the process of making love to his best man .",
    "i can guarantee that you ll find me a very generous lover ,  he said , touching her skin , his thumb rubbing along her lower lip .",
    "i d like to see you in brighter colors  dresses and outfits that will enhance your looks , not cover them up ,  he said simply and efficiently as if this was standard operating procedures for his girlfriends and lovers .",
    "here you go , lovey !",
    "before , she d definitely had male attention , being lovely by herself .",
    "you look lovely ,  he said .",
    "she loved clothes but had never chosen things this risque .",
    "he d never been so impatient to have made love in the shower , and against the wall .",
    "she was living a life more luxurious than she d ever imagined she could live , she was with the man she d fallen in love with several years ago and this time , the affair might last a little longer than the week she d had before .",
    "on the other hand , she loved the fact that she had a car waiting for her convenience and nik had handed her a wallet this morning filled with credit cards and cash .",
    "when he d pulled her into his arms , his intention had been to make love to her slowly so she was begging him , pleading with him to give her release .",
    "breathing heavily , he pulled her onto his chest , his hands running through her wet hair as he enjoyed hearing her small gasps as she slowly came down from the high of their lovemaking .",
    "nik was the ultimate lover , relentless and controlled up to a certain point .",
    "that point was usually when she started touching him back and he lost all the control he was trying to savor as he tortured her with his lovemaking .",
    "tabitha , dressed only in a towel since she was still considering her options , stared at the lovely blond woman wearing a satin slip dress and almost nothing else .",
    "he had her in his arms and all he wanted to do was carry her off to his bedroom and make love to her .",
    "nik had never invited any of his lovers to a family gathering , knowing what everyone would assume .",
    "she was completely uninhibited while making love , actually a tigress who was both demanding and amazingly giving .",
    "well , i find that , with my current lover , as soon as he s satisfied me once , i want him again and again .",
    "who would have thought that fateful morning that she would be sitting here contemplating her love for nik ?",
    "but as she thought about her relationship , she acknowledged that it was real love .",
    "they laughed and talked and made love like there was no tomorrow .",
    "other times , she would seduce him , making love to him on her terms .",
    "but she also knew that jimmy loved having the extra free time to be with his family .",
    "because the woman you really love would probably be devastated and you would be miserable because your wife is not your lady love",
    "nik laughed , feeling a rush of love for his father who was never too old to play with children , loving all of his grandchildren and spoiling them terribly .",
    "i agree , my love ,  his mother , stasi andretti said .",
    "you love this woman although i m not sure you re willing to admit that .",
    "i d spent a miserable two weeks in a hotel room while jerry and his lover traipsed about the island together .",
    "there were hats , gloves , shoes , dresses , slacks , shirts , evening gowns , ball gowns and clothes she had no idea why she would wear them .",
    "secondly , i do nt sleep with people i m not in love with",
    "i fell in love with you four years ago but my father told me that all you wanted from me was money .",
    "taking a deep breath , she shook her head ,  i guess i never fell out of love with you .",
    "i d never been in love before so i did nt know how to handle the emotion",
    "her heart was telling her that he was in love with her , but her mind , so recently hurt , was afraid to grasp at the straw .",
    "you loved me back then ?",
    "i loved you then and love you now",
    "one month later , tabitha took the hand of the man she d fallen in love with more than four years ago , her love for nik shining through in her eyes and receiving the same message in return .",
    "i love you ,  she whispered as the priest droned on about marriage and duty .",
    "i love you too ,  he said and bent to gently kiss her lips .",
    "but then , he d never met two people more in love , he reminded himself .",
    "all those lovely , glistening muscles were descending that ladder , his strong hands flexing as he grasped and ungrasped the ladder while he climbed down and her eyes were drawn to the appearing and disappearing muscles along his arms and back .",
    "she might love these shoes , but her feet did nt love walking in them .",
    "molly leaned against the doorway , pressing her lips together as she contemplated how to answer the lovely woman s question .",
    "molly chuckled at the lovely woman s disappointment .",
    "you were telling me you d love to have dinner with me tonight ,  he came right back .",
    "he loved watching the storms blow in , accepting that he was nt powerful or omniscient .",
    "emerson looked at her and wanted to take her into his arms and make love to her right here in the sunshine .",
    "emerson saw the emotions flit over her lovely , delicate features and something struck him hard .",
    "brianna was a reporter who loved reporting on the beauty in the world , even if it was a garden party or the latest society wedding .",
    "and nikki was a sweet , kind , gentle , dynamo school teacher who loved her job but not all the abuse she had to take from the parents who liked to push her around .",
    "he actually loved the stuff , but he also knew the best places to grab one .",
    "she was about to say the statues but stopped herself , thinking back to the nude statues done in the white marble .",
    "she wanted him to rip her clothes off and make love to her .",
    "she d always thought she d be in a long term relationship , not necessarily marriage but in love with someone , before she took this monumental step .",
    "yes , she was going to make love with jack .",
    "it was nt love , she accepted .",
    "i love these ,  he told her , nuzzling the lace there on her upper thigh .",
    "when he shifted his weight , he gritted his teeth as her wet heat surrounded him , clenching him like a glove .",
    "he rolled over so he was on top of her again and proceeded to make love to her in a much slower , more thorough fashion .",
    "she loved learning to sail but had nt brought the right clothes to be out on the ocean .",
    "she loved the seals and walruses the most , loved the rock  theatre  they d built so the guests could sit down and watch the antics of the fascinating animals .",

    "talked to him , laughed with him and made love to him as jack .",
    "his hands felt so good and she loved being in his company .",
    "she started to say that she was in love with him , but stopped herself just in time .",
    "she was in love with him !",
    "on the one hand , she d loved every moment spent in jack s company .",
    "what if every moment they were together , they laughed and loved and raised children and chickens ?",
    "he stopped , bracing himself for the hurt in those lovely , green eyes .",
    "holding rachel close , all he wanted to do was bury himself in her heat and make love to her .",
    "but she was exhausted and he preferred his lovers conscious and he knew that she was still confused and angry .",
    "and , what made everything worse , she wanted emerson so badly , she was almost crying over her need to have him hold her and make love to her .",
    "she used to love the man but she d been in love with jack .",
    "there had been flashes of his dominating , powerful persona behind the laughing , beguiling man she d learned to love .",
    "rachel loved the way the three of them would traipse down the rough path , chatting about their week , laughing at their foibles while cheering each other s successes .",
    "this was the  emerson  side of the man she d fallen in love with .",
    "or had she loved it ?",
    "she did nt have to pedal hard to catch up to him and since it was such a lovely day , she decided to stop trying to figure out what he was doing or why they were here .",
    "it was a lovely morning , made only slightly harder since she had nt had a healthy breakfast .",
    "she knew how many nights she d longed for him to just come to her room and take her into his arm to make love to her .",
    "you re going to love the island ,  he told her .",
    "it had been warmer the last time , but she d loved every moment of it .",
    "he loved sailing and was out on the water as often as possible .",
    "you re cute when you re at your wit s end , love",
    "she could tell that he loved sailing when they left the portland harbor and he released the main sail which quickly billowed out with the wind .",
    "her mouth dropped open as she stared at the lovely house , irritated by how easy it was to access the house .",
    "she d loved their cottage , had spent some great moments in it and she was nt going to sleep with him tonight .",
    "rachel loved the image of the gruff molly trying to play cupid by making a cold weather , spicy meal .",
    "i thought that , if i could only make it to the wall street gang , i d love it .",
    "this was the man she loved .",
    "so what you re saying is that i should find something i love doing and i ll eventually be successful",
    "rachel clung to his large frame , wanting to show him how much she loved him , how astonished she was that she felt so free , so liberated !",
    "i love you ,  she finally said when he finally lifted his head .",
    "i love you too ,  he told her .",
    "he took her hand while he said those lovely words and slipped a beautiful diamond ring onto her finger .",
    "good morning , my love ,  he said with that low , rumbling voice that never failed to send excited tingles down her whole body .",
    "liza covered her mouth and giggled , lilly stared at the two of them with confused attention and jefferson continued to stuff yogurt covered blueberries into his mouth , unaware of the undercurrents but completely secure in the knowledge that his mother and father loved and were loved .",
    "most of the women here tonight were either celebrities or trust fund recipients themselves , or lovely little mercenaries trying to get their moment of glory by selling their voluptuous bodies to someone from the first group .",
    "she was lovely , but also a distraction .",
    "but he read people easily and he knew that this woman , this lovely , nervous and gentle woman was not used to being in an environment like this .",
    "rocco loved beautiful women and he was fascinated by mysteries .",
    "this lovely brunette stimulated both his body and his curiosity .",
    "he was always generous with the lovers he took to his bed .",
    "she loved plants , wished she could grow something , anything !",
    "the song that had originally felt like a rocktechno beat turned into a love song with his arms around her .",
    "she was his to control and she loved his raw power , relinquished her own control to him , giving him whatever he wanted because it was what she wanted as well .",
    "rocco came back from the bathroom and looked down at the incredible woman sprawled out on his bed , her curls spread out on his pillow and all he wanted to do was make love to her again .",
    "he rejected both options and pulled the sheets over his lovely lady , pulling her against him .",
    "he had nt ever been with a virgin before , and was astonished that someone as lovely and sexy as brianna had nt ever been with another man .",
    "rocco was nt the kind of lover who let one think .",
    "she took a moment to pick up his tie that had come off in the middle of the hallway and fold it neatly on a table with a lovely painting of ..",
    "rocco slammed open the doors to his library , ready to pounce on the lovely lady .",
    "no lovely , conniving brunette smiling with victory anywhere !",
    "he should have gone home with one of the lovely ladies tonight who had been more than willing to take brianna s place .",
    "she had to stop thinking about rocco antoniv as the ultimate lover and remember that he was doing something extremely wrong .",
    "it really looked lovely , she thought , seeing the barn in the back where she d hidden .",
    "he could do anything and she would love it ?",
    "that news did nt cheer him since he was aching to make love to her , but he did nt want her getting sick on him either",
    "he did nt stop until they were in the small dining room he preferred when he was alone .",
    "rocco noticed the almost defeated look on her lovely face and did nt like it .",
    "he might have underestimated this little lovely , he thought .",
    "one night with this lovely lady was definitely not enough .",
    "chess would be lovely ,  she finally got out , the telltale blush moving up her neck and flaring into her cheeks .",
    "i wo nt believe them and it will simply draw my eyes to those lovely lips of yours",
    "it was a lovely view where they could play chess and still watch the snow fall outside .",
    "and then she gasped in delight as she saw the lovely room done in soft lavender with a fluffy white comforter , sheer curtains tied back at the four corners of the bed that went all the way up to the ceiling .",
    "his lovely houseguest had been sleeping for two hours .",
    "since she loved walking through the snow , she did nt fight the option .",
    "he even plunked a wool cap on her head and tied a scarf around her neck before stuffing her hands into gloves that were slightly too big , but would still keep her warm and dry .",
    "rocco smiled , but it was more for this lovely mystery woman .",
    "rocco suspected that many of the boys had been trying to get this lovely lady s attention as well and he felt honored that none had ever captured her interest .",
    "i d love to ride one ,  she said and then froze , shocked at what she d just admitted .",
    "that made the snow perfectly packable and her gloved hands quickly formed a snowball .",
    "do nt do that , love ,  he groaned .",
    "and , i love that event .",
    "chapter 6 one blissful week later , a week spent in his bed , laughing and learning about this complicated man that she d fallen madly in love with , she could nt believe how her life had changed .",
    "thank you , my love ,  rocco said behind her with his wonderfully deep voice .",
    "i love you so much and the idea of never seeing you again was horrible",
    "it was his way of helping those who endured the same thing all of them had gone through as kids and she loved him even more for being so kind and generous .",
    "rocco heard the sound , always so attuned to every nuance of his lovely wife and cursed under his breath .",
    "oh , how lovely ,  the hostess said , even while she was waving an imperious hand towards the doorway where two of rocco s body guards were standing by .",
    "take it slow , love ,  he said and practically lifted her out of the seat and put her onto the wheel chair .",
    "we re not finished with this discussion , my love ,  he told her angrily .",
    "i love you ,  he whispered in her ear .",
    "i love you too ,  she said and leaned her head back .",
    "the expression on your lovely face told me that you were nt completely satisfied with my response",
    "he threw back his head and laughed , delighted with her stony expression even while her cheeks turned a lovely shade of pink .",
    "now what , my love ?",
    "i d love to see what your next move is going to be",
    "i want you to come to my bed willingly , to be begging me to make love to you .",
    "i am ruler here , my lovely .",
    "nazar watched with growing desire as the lovely woman stretched on the soft , dark bed .",
    "he had a hard time keeping his eyes on her lovely features so , in the end , he simply gave up the fight and let his eyes wander over her delicious figure .",
    "you re going to have to face one of your fears , my love .",
    "either make love with me or learn to ride a horse",
    "i love riding and so that means you re going to have to learn to ride",
    "there were beautiful slacks and bright shirts and sweaters , lovely suits and skirts ..",
    "looking at all of the lovely colors , her fingers slid over the dresses , feeling the exquisite fabrics and loving all of them .",
    "they were lovely , but she would nt be here long enough to wear any of them .",
    "it was amazingly lovely , but obviously someone lived here , otherwise , there would nt be so many clothes in the closet .",
    "think of being on top and moving , shifting with your lover for maximum pleasure",
    "it was almost like he was making love to her on the horse .",
    "she actually leaned closer to him , her cheek resting against his muscular chest and she enjoyed hearing his heartbeat , loved the way his arms held her gently , as if she were something precious .",
    "but now , knowing that she had never been touched by any man ..",
    "well , he was enough of an old fashioned man to like the idea of being her only lover .",
    "only to you , my love ,  he said but would nt give her time to respond because his mouth covered hers , nikki had no idea how long they stood there .",
    "he paused , his eyes moving over her lovely features as he mulled something through in his mind .",
    "brianna had always felt inadequate because her father had chosen death over love for his daughter .",
    "and he wanted to make love to her until she was nt thinking about the parents that had died on her when they should have lived or her friend s father who was too much of a coward to take care of his child .",
    "no , my little love , you smell like peaches most of the time",
    "with that , his mouth covered hers , his hands pulling her so that she was flush against his hard , male body , all of her parts fitting perfectly against all of his male parts and she loved it .",
    "she might love the battle , but here and now , with her body fighting her mind to just give in , she took one last shot at selfpreservation .",
    "she was trembling with the need to just throw herself into his arms and beg him to make love to her .",
    "i love your reactions ,  he told her , his voice even deeper .",
    "she d tried so hard to avoid falling in love with him , but he was just too ..",
    "she loved talking with him , being with him , laughing with him and , especially , making love with him .",
    "the anticipation of seeing nazar for dinner , knowing he would take her into his arms afterwards and make love to her for the better part of the night , made the whole day seem slow , while the nights flew by much too quickly .",
    "she was completely , madly in love with the man .",
    "she did nt want to think about the morning she woke up without him kissing her , or chuckling over her fatigue because he d kept her up most of the night making love to her .",
    "but every time she was in his company , she fell a little bit more in love with him .",
    "she remembered reading a romance novel a long time ago where the guy in charge had a secret chamber where his harem , or maybe it was one of his wives , had a place where she could watch her husband in the throne room .",
    "she knew that nazar was the ultimate lover and a small part of her even thought that he was the man who was specially made for her .",
    "and after this , you re going to have to admit that you love me ,  he told her with victory in those fascinating eyes of his .",
    "i ve loved you for a while now .",
    "but you do nt love me , right ?",
    "this one was a lovely , elaborate room that would look perfect in any european government center .",
    "she d finally fell in love ?",
    "upset that one of my best friends is happy and has found a man she loves ?",
    "he sighed with relief , grateful once again for her generous nature and her sincere love for her friend .",
    "you drive me crazy with your adorable body walking into any room and all i want to do is throw you down onto any surface and make love to you .",
    "i love the way your mind works , i think you re fascinating to talk to , argue with and just be around .",
    "it seems like nothing scares you , but deep down , you re just a beautiful woman who wo nt let her fears hold her back from protecting the ones you love and experiencing life",
    "i want to fight with you , love with you and be with you .",
    "i m sure you ll be the first to know when they arrive , my love",
    "rachel had four kids and loved every moment of being a mother to her wild clan .",
    "as you can see , i love cooking ..",
    "they hinted she loved gardening , canning , and all the domestic arts .",
    "they played up both her toughness  she played first base in high school baseball  and her femininity  she loved quilting  what an outright lie  .",
    "back then , her mom , teresa , loved to take autumn and her sister , lily , to visit museums , see movies and plays , walk in central park and shop in the ethnic groceries that surrounded their home .",
    "still , just for one moment she imagined herself standing side by side ethan at the altar of some country church , pledging her love to him .",
    "darn , citypretty s readers loved snarky articles that skewered the mannerisms of the lesser orders  that is , anyone who was nt a young , upwardly mobile urbanite .",
    "he was talking about his family , but he could have been crooning a love song with that rough , masculine tone .",
    "based solely on the asinine video rob put up on the web , she d deemed him worthy of being her partner , protector  and lover  for the rest of her life .",
    "their lovemaking was like nothing she d ever known .",
    "no matter that lacey made him a loser in the love department .",
    "he thought his parents  deaths would be the end of him  two of the people he loved most in the world snuffed out with no chance to say goodbye .",
    "he loved your mom , maybe a little too much since it seems to have knocked the sense right out of him , but love does that sometimes .",
    "she was flushed and tousled and so beautiful he wanted to pitch her onto the bed and make love to her until neither of them could think straight .",
    "she loved puttering in the kitchen , but had no problem sharing the job with someone else .",
    "she loved to cook , and if ethan wanted her to take over the kitchen while she was here , she d be more than happy to oblige .",
    "lord knew , he could spend all day exploring autumn s body , making sweet love to her until ..",
    "she hesitated , her fingers in her lap worrying each other until he wanted to reach across and take both of them in his .",
    "ethan , please make love to me",
    "she wanted him for him and she would nt make him seek or beg or wait for her love .",
    "would she still be here , making love to him under the sun ?",
    "he d loved her to distraction  he d wanted her happy , and so he did whatever it took to make sure she stayed that way , even if it meant mortgaging the ranch to the hilt .",
    "why not look for love in his own home town ?",
    "you had sex with me  made love to me  within hours of meeting me , and again at lunch time today .",
    "we re supposed to fall in love first , then get married , then make love",
    "i should have said something last night before we made love .",
    "women could nt tell if they were pregnant within 24 hours of making love .",
    "they had to stop making love until they d sorted out their problems and tied the knot .",
    "i loved her , but she did nt belong on a ranch .",
    "telling her he loved her .",
    "over the last few days he d driven her all over the ranch , showing her the land he loved and the cattle herds he depended on to make his living .",
    "but it was the evenings she loved the most .",
    "as much as they did their best to satisfy each other without actually making love , autumn did nt think she could ever be satisfied until she had him again  body and soul .",
    "you made love to her without protection  the chances might be better than you think .",
    "what feasts she could prepare here , and how lovely a setting in which to do so .",
    "their passionate lovemaking and the afternoon spent gardening and cooking had driven all thought of her return to new york right out of her mind .",
    "a handsome , caring fiance who loved children .",
    "first she d agreed to marriage  well , she d fakeagreed to it  then she d gotten pregnant  maybe  and now she was falling in love with her intended .",
    "and the way he made love to her ...",
    "yes , she loved ethan cruz .",
    "but did he love her back ?",
    "i love looking at wedding gowns , and i ve got a good eye !",
    "only a truly wicked woman dumps the man she loves in the moment of his biggest defeat and then adds insult to injury by trying to turn others against him .",
    "he s a cowboy and i love him and we re going to run a guest ranch and i totally love him .",
    "i love ethan , and his financial situation is just fine  we ve already figured out exactly what we re going to do .",
    "i m getting married next saturday at 4 oclock in the afternoon right here at ethan s ranch , and i d love for you and lily to be here  but only if you come to support me .",
    "i did nt realize you loved the ranch that much",
    "she loves to cook and she s amazing at it .",
    "so when rob brought that lovely lady of his home and eased her into the bedroom , she about nearly had a fit !",

    "get it in your head  i love autumn .",
    "no  she loved ethan , she was sure of that .",
    "you want proof ethan s still in love with me ?",
    "there was no way ethan was getting off to her answering machine in his office every night and then coming out and making love to her with a passion that swept her off her feet .",
    "he was still in love with lacey  or in lust , or something .",
    "at the very least he spent nearly twenty minutes every night with her naked image before he was able to make love to her .",
    "she was a pathetic standin for the woman ethan truly loved and there was no way she d spend her life as someone else s second choice .",
    "we both know you still love lacey",
    "i have loved you from the minute i saw you walk through the airport and i want you to be my wife .",
    "i was saved from an unhappy marriage before it was too late , and then i was led to you  the woman i love more than anything .",
    "but i love you more than you will ever know",
    "and if you love me half as much as i love you , i think we have a good shot at making it",

    "i love you more than life itself",
    "i love you , ethan ,  she said .",
    "you fell in love with her over time and changed your mind about the joke",

    "would she be left all alone in new york as her son or daughter fell in love with the ranch and chose their father over her ?",
    "no , i know you do nt love me .",
    "and i do nt really love you , either .",
    "i ve never loved anyone the way she loves you , and i finally get why  it s because i hate myself too much",
    "he reached for autumn s laptop reluctantly , wondering what lacey had seen there that changed her mind about love so completely .",
    "today i fell in love with a man and my whole life has changed .",
    "i love this feeling  like one minute with him can wash away every care in the world .",
    "to hell with writing an article  i m going to write a love story , instead  between me and ethan .",
    "autumn loved him and he was nt going to waste another minute apart from her .",
    "and then he chose me , and i came out here ..",
    "i did nt think i d fall in love with him !",
    "i m so stupid  i thought he loved me back , too .",
    "she d lost everything she loved and her future spread before her as bleak as a moonscape and far less interesting .",
    "i fell in love with you .",
    "she exchanged a private look with him at the memory of their lovemaking on the treads beneath their feet as they climbed to the second level of the big house .",
    "i love you , autumn , always and forever",
    "i love you always and forever , too",
    "instead , they d fallen head over heels in love , and rumor had it autumn was pregnant with ethan s baby .",
    "he d practically grown up on the cruz ranch , since he loved horses and his family lived in town .",
    "to have been so close  to let himself picture what it would be like to finally hold her in his arms , to finally make love to her  and then to have that dream yanked away from him again ..",
    "he d almost despaired of ever carrying the day .",
    "she may have dated the guy for a couple of years , but apparently she was nt in love with daniel , after all .",
    "she loved the way he moved , the way he did his chores .",
    "she wanted to work with him , ride with him , build a life with him based on their shared love of the ranch .",
    "he actually dropped to his knees as if he was going to propose for real , except if he was serious , he would have mentioned the word love somewhere in the last ten minutes .",
    "he knew ethan could barely breathe for love of her , and he was happy for his friend , but try as he might he could nt keep his eyes on ethan s bride .",
    "forget inviting her to ride the horse he d handpicked for her and taking her all over the land and reminding her just how much she loved this place .",
    "he had intended to walk her step by step through a process of falling back in love with the ranch , with horses , and with him .",
    "claire always appreciated that about him , because she loved horses , too .",
    "they really are in love .",
    "a sudden image entered her mind of the two of them boarding an airplane , flying off to their honeymoon on an island shore where they could make love for days ..",
    "for heaven s sake  what was wrong with her ?",
    "i m sorry  the romance of the occasion turned my head",
    "but as soon as i got here i understood why autumn fell in love with the place",
    "fell in love with ethan , you mean",
    "you spend six weeks here with me , working at all the things you used to love and then you tell me you d rather travel the world than get married .",
    "happiness for ethan mixed with the ache that came from knowing no man had ever loved her the way he loved autumn .",
    "uh uh  she was supporting lovers over there .",
    "you can stand there and tell me you regret making love with me , but i wo nt let you go back on your promise to help me out",
    "he d made love to her .",
    "she d made love to jamie , and it had felt so good .",
    "after all this time and what he d done , she still loved him .",
    "she studied the ring , a ring she d be proud to wear under different circumstances  if jamie really loved her , and if he was capable of sustaining that love .",
    "making love to jamie every night .",
    "once upon a time aria had loved her .",
    "getting claire back on a horse was just the first step in making her fall back in love with ranch life .",
    "not when the bastard she d loved but left her was coming back to steal the business from her .",
    "wanted to make love to him again .",
    "and he sure seemed to love lacey .",
    "if only she could stop thinking about revenge and start thinking about ..",
    "not once in all this time had jamie mentioned love .",
    "he could tell she was already half in love with storm .",
    "when they drew rein on the rise of ground where a scant few weeks ago they d made love under the moonlight , he did nt even look at claire .",
    "it is lovely here ,  she said .",
    "because you re still in love with daniel ?",
    "i thought he loved me .",
    "she was lovely , but far more cautious than she used to be .",
    "her mother s betrayal had driven her from the ranch and while he read her love for this land in every glance she caressed it with , he also read the fear there .",
    "the one thing she loved above all else .",
    "she loved this time of day , when the afternoon wound down and the comfort of a montana summer evening loomed ahead .",
    "because underneath all that smooth charm was a man who loved horses , was as smart as a whip , and who knew what he wanted and exactly how to get it .",
    "all he wanted was a place to hang his hat and a chance to work with his beloved horses for the rest of his life .",
    "i think for all their troubles your parents loved each other",
    "if that s what love looks like , count me out",
    "i think she loved your dad no matter how she behaved",
    "claire wanted him  he knew she did now that she d given in to her impulses and made love to him .",
    "maybe if he succeeded she d realize he loved only her .",
    "autumn thinks it s because she loved dad .",
    "hey , lovebirds ,  rob bellowed from the far end of the table .",
    "she d always envisioned her mother having a string of foreign lovers when she traveled to europe on her monthslong jaunts .",
    "he loved to talk and show off and be the center of attention .",
    "mom decided she still loved your dad and wanted to go back to him  back to montana  but she was afraid he would ditch her if she came home with a child .",
    "to have aria tell her that she was the only daughter she really loved .",
    "to have her say that she loved her at all .",
    "her mother had loved her , had nt she ?",
    "she loved you two so much",
    "but they d loved her , both of them .",
    "her clients loved that about her .",
    "do nt you love the ring he bought you ?",
    "i love it  it s perfect for you",
    "i m sure there are plenty of people whose marriages will last that i do nt get the hunch about because they re still learning to love each other .",
    "i think it means that you re so busy thinking about yourself you have no love to give",
    "he thought back to the night they d made love under the moon .",
    "maybe she felt the time was right for romance , too .",
    "he promised he d hang out at his cabin until midnight , then go to intercept jamie s wouldbe lover .",
    "ready to make love to her until she cried aloud .",
    "when we were growing up i loved everything about this place , and i came here for a bunch of reasons .",
    "all i m saying is i love the feel of your hands on my breasts",
    "you do have lovely breasts , claire",
    "he wanted to tell her what she was doing to him , how much he loved her , how he wanted to spend his life with her .",
    "she was a glorious sight and he loved her , wanted her , needed her ..",
    "with a wild cry she bucked against him and jamie came , too , caught up in her abandon .",
    "she d never made love to a man like that  taking all control .",
    "no one loves me ,  christine wailed .",

    "she gazed at evan , still rubbing his jaw , and knew it was true  she did love him .",

    "ya ll look lovely with these babies ,  he said before he ran up the stairs , taking them two at a time so he could shower off the ranch dust .",

    "laying her carefully in the center of the bed , he looked down at her and promised himself that he would go slow , teach her about making love and make sure she felt everything he was feeling .",
    "they made love three more times that night .",
    "each time elissa snuggled up to him in her sleep , she woke him up enough to be aware of her which meant that he made love to her again and again , always satisfying her more than she could ever have imagined .",
    "what about if i wear gloves ?",
    "elissa , when are you going to admit that you re in love with jake ?",
    "honey , if you only knew jake , you d know he s head over heels in love with you too",

    "she had no idea what he was going to discuss with her , but she was going to face him with courage and love .",
    "i do nt know what i ll do , but i love this country life",
    "that man is in love with you , have no doubt about that ,  she said confidently .",
    "and too many romance novels ,  she added .",

    "you put yourself out there , looking incredibly lovely and way too tempting .",
    "oh , no , lovely one .",
    "because i m thinking you would be a wonderful lover ,  she sighed , smiling up at him , unsure where she gathered the courage to flirt like this .",
    "they had made love so many times during the night she had lost count a few hours ago .",
    "she loved her job , but lately , she had been hard pressed to concentrate .",
    "to make matters worse , the moment she d walked into his office , all he d wanted to do was to make love to her again .",
    "i can be a very generous lover ,  he said , his eyes drilling into hers .",
    "that she d spent the last ten years taking care of two other people and wanted to experience love ?",
    "adam s building was magnificently decorated with marble and brass , lovely trees situated in strategic places and soft music playing discreetly in the background .",
    "adam would come home in the evening , usually around nine or ten oclock at night , he would immediately make love to her and they would fall asleep in each other s arms , completely replete and exhausted .",
    "from gerard , she discovered that she really loved to cook .",
    "at that point , he simply pulled her into his arms and made love to her for the rest of the night .",
    "she was now in his luxurious apartment and the lover of a passionate man that took her breath away .",
    "she was still here and adam made love to her every night but never spoke to her about anything other than mild inquiries into her day .",
    "adam noted the challenge in her face and walked over to her , staring down into her lovely , angry features .",
    "she loved feeling the muscles underneath his dark suit and the expert way he held her and led her through the dance .",
    "adam was a demanding lover and she had been up several times last night .",
    "the man simply loved embarrassing her , did nt he ?",
    "they spent the rest of the meal talking about nothing in particular but alicia loved getting to know him a little more .",
    "i thought all women loved getting new clothes .",
    "and not only that , he had a new leather jacket , a helmet , leather gloves , all of it .",
    "but also because she was in love with adam .",
    "it was the first night in more than a month in which he had nt touched her , made love with her .",
    "adam was an amazing lover , anticipating all of her needs to the point of making sure she had fresh coffee as soon as she woke up , even if he was already out in the ocean swimming for exercise .",
    "she hated the fact that she d fallen in love with the man .",
    "gone was the hard and demanding lover of the first week .",
    "after coming home , his first priority was always making love .",
    "she d always loved numbers and the story they told but she also remembered her high school love of writing .",
    "after making love , they would shower and heat up whatever was left in the refrigerator for that night .",
    "lovely blush , my dear girl which is extremely telling ,  he said and started unloading the groceries .",
    "he s a wonderful cook and you love most of his meals",
    "his lovemaking that night was different .",
    "you ll love it ,  he said reassuringly .",
    "she followed nancy through the store , her hungry , fashion starved gaze caressing the lovely outfits sitting on the racks or mannequins as she walked through the store .",
    "the moment she d walked into the room , he d wanted to pin her down to the sofa and make love to her .",
    "the gracious looking mansion with the weathered stones was out of some sort of historical romance novel , complete with turrets on both ends and pointed windows on three stories .",
    "alicia instantly fell in love with the room as well as the amazing view out of the windows that lined one wall of the great room .",
    "taking a deep breath to calm herself , alicia acknowledged that she had her only saving grace at the moment was that adam had nt seen her  that sounds lovely but you ll have to guide me to the pool .",
    "this loverlike attention could really go to her head .",
    "so long to the lover , back was the arrogant , domineering man who wanted to control each aspect of her life .",
    "adam was nt sure what he wanted to do first to this lovely minx who threw him for a loop at almost every turn .",
    "her husband maintains the yard and is in love with adam since jerry is allowed to do anything he wants with the grounds",
    "suddenly , the path opened up to a lovely pool bordered on all sides by flowers , potted flowering bushes and trees that seemed to bend over the patio , creating almost a canopy at one end of the pool .",
    "this is lovely ,  alicia said , spreading her towel out onto a dark green chaise lounge .",
    "even his lovemaking , if she could call it that since he was nt in love with her , was like a powerful force that overwhelmed every part of her sense .",
    "so when did you fall in love with him ?",
    "you re in love with him .",
    "i m not in love with adam",
    "not because he s been in love but simply because he has nt found anyone worthy of love .",
    "but what he really needs , even if he wo nt accept it , is a woman who loves him for himself and not for all the things she can get from him",
    "adam wo nt ever fall in love with me ,  alicia replied , unknowingly revealing the sadness she felt in her heart .",
    "i just could nt stand to see my lovely wife being so sweet , innocent and dignified .",
    "this was the man she was in love with , she thought .",
    "he wanted her body but not her love .",
    "i love the effort but i do nt think you re ready to play the siren yet",
    "rosa discovered the drink in a romance novel a few weeks ago and has been eager to try it out on her guinea pigs ,  he explained .",
    "turning to his wife he said ,  that look means that he knows he can beat me yet again but he s being too polite to say so in front of my lady love ,  he explained , humor in his eyes .",
    "i ll have these lovely ladies on my side to cheer me on ,  he said .",
    "making love to adam with laughter was a wonderful experience , she thought an hour later as she pulled on a pair of shorts .",
    "she d fallen in love with him .",
    "and if it did nt work out , if she discovered that adam could nt return her love or even start to care for her , then she would deal with that later .",
    "they swam and adam worked , eventually alicia dozed off , exhausted after the evening with adam in which she had nt gotten much sleep since he d made love to her twice .",
    "he took her to a lovely restaurant for dinner and she wore her last cocktail dress , feeling extremely special walking next to adam who was dressed in a sharp suit with a maroon tie .",
    "she loved hearing his strong heartbeat and feeling his muscles as they wrapped around her .",
    "her lipstick was gone but her lips were still red , her cheeks rosy and there was a starry eyed look on her face that probably told the whole world that she was in love with adam .",
    "but right now , with the promise of adam s lovemaking to guide her into the night , she could nt care less .",
    "for the rest of the night , she felt loved and secure .",
    "she loved listening as adam showered and shaved for the day .",
    "besides , he d made love to her quite thoroughly just the previous evening .",
    "adam looked down into her lovely face , noting with satisfaction the tumbled hair and the slightly swollen lips .",
    "refocusing on her lovely face and easy smile , he said ,  how do i wake up ?",
    "another part of him wanted to pull her into his arms and make love to her , more intrigued by the woman he was slowly getting to know .",
    "in fact , he loved her .",
    "it was all because of love .",
    "could she ever love him in return ?",
    "in fact , she d probably loved him from the start .",
    "he d been her first lover and that was probably only curiosity .",
    "he fell asleep thinking of several ways he d get her to admit her feelings for him , all of them ending with the two of them making love .",
    "and number two , she was hoping that she could tease him into making love to her once he hung up the phone .",
    "if he hurt himself before she had a chance to tell him she loved him , she would be very angry with him .",
    "i m sure he s probably pathetic if you re still his lover .",
    "i know i would be out spending his lovely money as fast as they could print it .",
    "she said , ripping the lovely oil paintings and stunning photographs off the wall .",
    "i m saying that i love you and i know i can make you feel the same way .",
    "i do nt know when it happened , but somehow , i fell in love with you .",
    "that i m in love with you ?",
    "i love you ,  he said before covering her mouth with his again .",
    "he asked , not the slightest bit embarrassed that he was almost making love with alicia while a crazy woman was carted out of his home .",
    "but you re going to have to have children with me and promise to love me for at least the next fifty years .",
    "but i disagree my love ,  he replied , one finger sliding sensuously across her cheek to brush against her extremely sensitive earlobe before dropping to her waist again .",
    "jason looked around her , down at the ground where the rusty tools were laying and her filthy work gloves were tossed .",
    "the two , lovely blond women had been the horror of her teen years .",
    "and , each night , he would make love to her until her senses were so filled with only him , she could nt think about anything else .",
    "jason had been the ultimate lover .",
    "she hated the idea of jason falling in love with the cold , calculating jocelyn who only wanted the prestige of jason s name and wealth .",
    "at least they were tears of frustration instead of the tears she d shed because of sadness , loneliness and a fear that jason would never love her the way she loved him .",
    "i know for a fact that jocelyn would love to be married to you",
    "sophie had always loved this time of the year .",
    "she loved the sound and stared up at him with undisguised fascination .",
    "if only jason loved her and she felt confident in that love .",
    "but jason was only her husband and obviously he did nt love her .",
    "you know how much i love a challenge , sophie",
    "but her body remembered and would nt be satisfied until she had all of him , covering her and making love to her .",
    "sophie loved the feel of him but after only a few minutes , he pushed her back onto her back again , leaning over her and spreading her legs again .",
    "sophie pulled off her gardening gloves and took the note , her teeth grinding in frustration as she read the words .",
    "without another word , she pulled her glove back on and started digging again .",
    "you re getting angry with me in order to not make love with me tonight ,  he said , one hand slipping under her hair to caress her neck .",
    "if jason were to pull her off to the side and make love to her right here , she knew she would nt be able to stop him .",
    "let me take a guess as to what s going on inside that lovely brain of yours ,  he said , his eyes flashing angry fire .",
    "you re embarrassed over how passionate we can be with each other ,  he said quietly but relentlessly ,  and last night , you let yourself fall into my arms and really make love for the first time in your life .",
    "we re going to make love tonight .",
    "and you re going to love it .",
    "and we re going to make love every night until you trust me enough to move to the next step",
    "she loved the fact that he d wanted her just as much , if not more , than she d wanted him .",
    "he proceeded to make love to her in the shower with sophie crying out , desperate for the release only he could give her .",
    "she wished she had something she could do on her own but until she figured out what she was going to do about her marriage , her only option , the only thing she knew how to do and loved doing , was gardening .",
    "her heart swelled with love for this man and she smiled brightly .",
    "brad , my love , you are delusional .",
    "they were a very fun couple and obviously in love for a long time .",
    "sophie , jason , thank you for a lovely evening ,  she said and took sophie s hand in hers , squeezing it slightly .",
    "i was happy , i was working doing something i loved until you came back into my life .",
    "i just did nt want you working for a man that was in love with you , sophie !",
    "do nt tell me you were in love with him , sophie because i will simply destroy the man .",
    "it s going to be lovely ,  he said , then looked right into her eyes .",
    "the whole reason had been because she wanted his love and knew that he could never love someone as drab and ordinary as she was .",
    "he had married her out of pity after losing her father and she d let him , knowing how much she d loved him from the first time she d seen him .",
    "she stepped out of his arms and picked up her shovel and gloves intending to go back to the house .",
    "a movie sounds lovely ,  she enthused , eager to spend the night not surrounded by strangers .",
    "she did nt admit that she d spent a lot of her alone time in that room , fantasizing about jason falling in love with her and announcing his intense and neverending love for her .",
    "she discovered that , although she wanted to be independent , she was still in love with her husband .",
    "she loved his smell , his irritating raised eyebrows when he disagreed with someone , she loved the way he kept his temper under control despite the fact that he genuinely disliked something someone said .",
    "it had only taken four days and she was right back in love with him .",
    "she loved feeling the new clothes and the textures .",
    "sophie went to bed that night , still missing jason and trying to figure out what she was going to do with herself to change her image into something jason would both respect and want to fall in love with .",
    "the thought that he had nt bothered to even say hello to her bothered her so deeply , she considered giving up on her plan on making him respect her and fall in love with her .",
    "that would be lovely ,  sophie said , relieved beyond belief and suddenly needing a chair to fall into .",
    "i guarantee that he will love every new outfit",
    "that would be lovely ,  she said .",
    "sophie looked down at her lovely blue dinner suit and smoothed the front lovingly .",
    "she was elegant but very down to earth , loved gardening and her children and mostly her husband .",
    "she loved the way the cut of the slacks made her legs look longer and her waist look small .",
    "all her hopes and dreams of jason falling in love with her were now squashed .",
    "besides his love , she thought , her mouth grimacing as a stab of pain sliced through her heart .",
    "she pushed the pain aside , knowing now that jason could never return her love .",
    "she loved gardening and she had good abilities to picture landscaping options in her mind .",
    "but she did nt , worried that he was only making love with her in order to keep her happy .",
    "looking out the window , she noticed it was going to be a lovely spring morning and she was feeling very daring .",
    "nor will jocelyn once she gets her hands on jason s lovely money",
    "she asked  where did you get this lovely little dress ?",
    "well , actually , she wanted to pull off his clothes and have him make love to her but she knew it was the middle of the morning and they were in his office .",
    "she loved the feel of his hardness and inhaled his sexy aftershave scent .",
    "and you look lovely ,  he stated a moment before he kissed her , taking off all her lipstick again .",
    "but a small part of her loved the way jason could make her feel .",
    "there were so many beautiful trees , she thought it would be lovely to make a place to sit during the hot , summer months .",
    "once he discovered her , he would get down on the ground and beg her to love him .",
    "but of course , she already did so it was a silly question but she would finally be able to declare her love for him openly .",
    "it would all be so perfect if he would just fall in love with her .",
    "she plunked her gloves into her gardening bucket and looked around in satisfaction .",
    "jason had made love to her after carrying her upstairs .",
    "it looks like a lovely day",
    "sophie loved the walk , enjoying the smell of the newly turned over soil that was prepared for the seeds from the farms .",
    "it was indeed a lovely day and she stopped at the coffee shop , reading the newspaper while sipping her coffee in the bright sunshine outside the coffee shop .",
    "i m sorry , love ,  he said .",
    "i promise i ll redeem myself in your eyes and become someone worthy of your love ,  he said .",
    "you want me to love you ?",
    "i love you so much but i ve failed you .",
    "i think i ve loved you since that very first dance we shared",
    "oh jason , i ve felt the same way but could nt imagine a day when you could actually love someone like me",
    "i ve woven so many fantasies about you telling me you love me but they were only fantasies .",
    "i ve loved you for so long and it has only gotten stronger the more i got to know you",
    "if you love me , why did you leave me ?",
    "because i thought you were in love with jocelyn .",
    "i loved you too much to bear it if you ever left me .",
    "the more i got to know you , the more i loved you .",
    "love ,  he said and kissed her gently .",
    "i think those two emotions could take me a long time to discuss with you ,  he said , his voice hoarse as he looked down into her green eyes shining up at his with love beaming back at him .",
    "and you love me too , do nt you ?",
    "i ve loved you for so long i ca nt remember a time when you were nt a big part of my fantasy life",
    "if you ll tell me you love me again",
    "epilogue sophie dropped her gardening gloves into her bucket and sighed happily .",
    "i thought you loved your business .",
    "maybe because , initially , i wanted to prove to you that i was worthy of your respect and possibly your love so i came up with the idea of a business .",
    "and what would be the next step , my love ?",
    "dominic carson rolled his eyes , ignoring the lovely woman s pale cheeks and the fascinating sparkle in those green eyes .",
    "it was soft and full , small tendrils coming out of the clip behind her head which curled around her lovely features .",
    "wine would be lovely , although i might just fall asleep this afternoon .",
    "dominic demanded , his eyes sharpening on her lovely features .",
    "in his mind , nothing was more imperative that figuring out how to get this woman into his bed so he could make love to her for the rest of the afternoon .",
    "she d gotten them when she d been a teenager and loved them so much that she d never changed them .",
    "so now that you are nt a virgin any longer , can you at least explain to me why it has taken you so long to choose a lover ?",
    "they d ended up talking on the phone for hours , her laughing at his arguments as to why she should become his lover , him chuckling at her rebuttals and giving him reasons why they should avoid each other like the plague .",
    "not that she would fall in love with him !",
    "it was worse now , knowing what she did about his body , about the way he made love as if it were a live or die exploration .",
    "and she d loved every moment of it .",
    "if he were nt in so much pain to make love to her , he might actually think she was cute .",
    "in that case , say i want you dominic  or how about take me out of here and make love to me , dominic  which would also work",
    "you are just too much of a ..",
    "she started to say something but he covered her mouth with his , kissing her as if he wanted to ..",
    ".well , he did want to make love to her .",
    "and sydney loved it on sight .",
    "when they were back out on the sidewalk in front of the lovely store , she pulled on his hand to try and get his attention .",
    "he should have picked her up and carried her back to his place , then made love to her until neither one of them could speak .",
    "i m also sure that you look incredibly lovely in that new suit",
    "he took her to lunch at yet another fabulously exclusive and amazingly lovely restaurant where he met with a very nice gentleman named ralph dorlov .",
    "i ca nt do that , love ,  he said and moved to the other side of her neck .",
    "she loved the way his hands felt on her waist , the way he was still warm and smelled so good .",
    "his mouth making love to hers , showing her with his lips and his tongue what she would be missing .",
    "she rolled her eyes when even her shoes were traded in for lovely new ones , all in colors that perfectly matched the new suits hanging in the closet .",
    "since she did nt have an alternative , she pulled out a lovely lilac pant suit , sifting through the boxes on the floor until she found a pair of matching , soft purple shoes .",
    "she quickly undid several buttons and loved the way his skin was rough , covered lightly with hair and felt like steel with all those hard , bulging muscles just underneath the surface .",
    "she loved that they disagreed because it added so much spice to their conversations .",
    "it was nt even a fetus yet , just a clump of cells but already , her heart swelled with love for this life .",
    "she had a lovely face and her wrinkles only added a gentleness to her smile .",
    "she wanted him to love her , to want her in his life .",
    "that lump seemed to increase in size but his words sounded lovely .",
    "you re the only lady love in my life , sydney",
    "i m not discussing my past lovers with you",
    "then i wo nt discuss my previous lovers either",
    "since i m your only lover , that does nt seem to make sense",
    "just because you were my first real lover , that does nt mean that ..",
    "she could nt finish since he d lifted her into his arms and kissed her , not allowing her to continue with her thought .",
    "how was she to handle seeing him with his next lady love ?",
    "she was in love with dominic carson !",
    "she looked up at the tall , handsome , difficult man she d fallen in love with and her chest wrenched with the idea of never seeing him again , of never rolling her eyes when he tried to act unbearable and annoying or domineering .",
    "she realized that she truly loved this man , all of his quirks and irritations as well as the secret , soft side of him that he tried to keep hidden away .",
    "her feelings for dominic were overwhelming her but she wanted him to need her , to love her and feel something other than lust for her .",
    "and she could nt force him to love her .",
    "that would nt be love , it would be obligation .",
    "you love me , i love you , what do i need to do to convince you that we were made for each other ?",
    "you said you loved me ,  she replied , smiling up at his handsome , confused face .",
    "i fell in love with you when you stood up to me on that first day .",
    "i loved it when you put me in my place",
    "i did nt want to fall in love with you",
    "i wish i could have fallen in love with you that quickly",
    "i m already having trouble understanding why i love you now",
    "you fell in love with me over that lunch when you finally let loose and argued with me .",
    "it might not have been as fast , but i knew you loved me just as powerfully as i did you .",
    "yes , but you love me ,  he came back , bending low to gently kiss her , holding her in his arms and showing him through his actions that his words of love were not a contradiction .",
    "i ll admit that i love you",
    "the woman crossed the elegantly decorated lobby and his eyes watched , his body instantly reacting to her lovely , innocent looking face and lush body .",
    "he did nt like the fact that other men turned to stare at her lovely face or spectacular figure as she made her way through the casino toward the management offices .",
    "oh , i love christmas ,  sabrina said enthusiastically .",
    "she liked dancing and loved the people she worked with , but was now determined to get a degree in law and was pursuing that with hard driving determination through the university of nevada , las vegas in every spare minute .",
    "no falling in love with sid matthews !",
    "eyes that were incredibly lovely , he thought .",
    "he also loved the way the wrapped bodice enhanced her voluptuous breasts , noting the interesting v where the dress dipped low , revealing only a slight curve of cleavage .",
    "sid also saw the surreptitious glance she gave him and the slight blush that moved across her lovely cheeks when she realized that he was watching her .",
    "it now purred like a kitten but it was nothing compared to how lovely his maserati probably drove .",
    "getting to know the man would just be detrimental to any possible love life in the future .",
    "she dreamed about making love with him , feeling his hands touching her body in a way that no other man had ever done before .",
    "she also loved her job .",
    "oh , how lovely ,  she said , taking in the incredible view of the las vegas lights through a bank of windows on two sides of the extremely large living room .",
    "when he had all those lovely ladies dressed in barely anything , what could she offer him ?",
    "and has the added benefit of getting all this stress out of your system so you wo nt be tempted to fall into my arms and let me make love to you tonight .",
    "i want you to feel the same insane desire to tear my clothes off me and make love with me that i feel as soon as i see you walking anywhere .",
    "you d look lovely in the green ,  he said .",
    "you have lovely hair ,  he said , his eyes moving over the fiery locks that were tightly controlled in her bun .",
    "when i make love to you , i want a bed and absolute privacy along with several hours to do it right",
    "we re still going to make love",
    "it was nt a declaration of undying love but would sid ever be able to say words like that ?",
    "she could nt see him uttering words of love but did she really need that ?",
    "sabrina looked at the incredibly beautiful ring , her smile growing as her own love for him started to blossom out of control , welling up inside her and threatening to choke her .",
    "it was bad enough that he d have to wait until his wedding night before making love to her .",
    "what does the lovely sabrina sleep in at night ?",
    "ah ,  he said , not bothering to look in front of him , enjoying the view of her lovely face instead .",
    "and add onto that , the fact that she d agreed to share her life , love and body with him , it added a whole new dimension to his character .",
    "that she was willing to commit to him so completely and not know about his past , meant she was really in love with him .",
    "she loved him , regardless of who he was ten or twenty years ago .",
    "she loved the fact that he appeared just as affected by their kisses as she was .",
    "she d feel so much more confident if sid loved her the way she loved him .",
    "she loved him for who he is now and whatever had happened in the past only made him stronger and more loveable .",
    "sid has never said he loves me ,  she explained , more of her anxiety coming out than she d intended .",
    "besides , i have enough love for the two of us ,  she said with more feeling .",
    "looking down the aisle at the man standing by the minister , her heart swelled with love and she hoped that every emotion was showing through her eyes .",
    "and maybe he d come to love her a little bit .",
    "she only half listened to the words of the service , her whole body shaking with excitement as sid stood next to her , his warm hands holding her cold ones and she could nt believe how much she loved him .",
    "i d love to see you try !",
    "he was going to make love to his wife and anyone who stopped him would be in trouble .",
    "the feeling made her both weak and strong and she loved the fact that this man wanted her so intensely .",
    "i love you , sid ,  she called out , overwhelmed and more satisfied that she could ever think of being .",
    "each night , sid took her into his arms and showed her how to make love in so many ways she had lost track .",
    "each moment with sid was more amazing than the one before and sabrina was completely , helplessly in love with her new husband .",
    "when they reached their hotel that night , she did model them for him , one after another until he pulled her down beneath him and made love to her , tearing the thin scraps of material off her body in a storm of passion .",
    "she loved even hearing his voice .",
    "said that he loved her , or even cared for her .",
    "sid had never once he showed her in so she knew going into this relationship that he did nt love her and she had to make her love enough for the two of them .",
    "but a stranger she loved getting to know each day .",
    "i would love to have the time to spend with our children but that s years in the future .",
    "i want to work and i love working for solara",
    "that s probably a few years into the future ,  she said , knowing that she was terrified of having children with a man who did nt love her .",
    "he made love to her until she was crying out for release and when he d given her body what she d demanded , she curled up in his arms as she floated off to sleep .",
    "mindy ,  sabrina started off , staring at the lovely three story brick home with a lovely view ,  i m sorry but can we hold off on the homes you have scheduled for the afternoon ?",
    "i do nt really want a home ,  she thought sadly as she plucked a rose out of a lovely arrangement that had been delivered that morning .",
    "or are you going to celebrate my good job by making love to me ?",
    "her ideas were thrown out to the staff and they loved them , even adding other ideas to them .",
    "the only problem she found was that sid still had nt told her that he loved her .",
    "she said it every time they made love .",
    "in fact , he never let her find her release , teasing her mercilessly until she cried out her love for him .",
    "but the deeper feelings of love and trust were never uttered .",
    "i ve seen my brother with a lot of women ,  zeke started and the pain that intensified in sabrina s eyes told him those were nt the right word so he continued quickly ,  but he loves you , sabrina .",
    "sid had never said he loved her .",
    "she d been fooling herself , thinking that she had enough love for the both of them .",
    "one where she would believe him if a naked woman threw herself at him , knowing he would push her away because she was secure with the knowledge that he loved her and only her .",
    "she was so in love with him she was in pain and only wanted to have him hold her , make love to her one more time before she had to leave .",
    "you do nt love me .",
    "you do nt love me and you never will .",
    "i m done pretending that you re ever going to fall in love with me and love me the way i love you .",
    "i love you , the man and not the wealth .",
    "you ve given me so much over the past three months but all i really wanted was you and your love",
    "i m sorry i never said i loved you .",
    "i love you more than life itself",
    "and i m afraid of losing your love .",
    "and if that does nt mean i m in love with you then i do nt know what is",
    "i ve never been one to feel loved but you ve changed me",
    "i want your love and trust",
    "i love you ,  she said , loving the feeling of his mouth on hers .",
    "as long as you continue to love me , that s all i want from you",
    "i love you ,  she said again .",
    "goodness she loved that man !",
    "i love you ,  she said .",
    "i love you too ,  he replied .",
    "she watched as the lovely woman clicked her camera over and over again , fascinated by her facial expressions .",
    "he moved in closer , his eyes noting the small shiver that ran down her slender form and the slight color that was pinkening her lovely , high cheekbones .",
    "i love watching people and making up stories about them .",
    "we can walk across the street and i will buy you that very lovely red dress hanging in the window of the boutique ,  he said .",
    "the store was dior and the dress was incredibly lovely but possibly cost over ten thousand dollars .",
    "they d met and married within one month , having fallen in love at first sight .",
    "it could also be because she d learned how to genuinely appreciate life through her mother , never taking anything very seriously , and then learned to dig in and find a career that she loved and could thrive in with her father .",
    "i love looking around and seeing things .",
    "as soon as he had her , made love to her and found out her secrets , she would be out of his blood .",
    "you re going to love edna"
